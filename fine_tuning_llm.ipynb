Premature atrial contractions or supraventricular ectopics are not harmful per se other than giving you symptoms. So antiarrhythmics are not usually recommended, so I do not disagree with your treating cardiologist. Beta blocker is the safest option available, although not the most effective one and other options are ablation or antiarrhrythmics. So trying behavioral techniques is a good option. But if it troubles you a lot then you may request low dose antiarrhythmics like Amiodarone for a short period of time, but they may again come back after the drug is stopped. Since there is no atrial fibrillation or SVT (supraventricular tachycardia), antiarrhythmics are absolutely necessary, but the benefit would be in you is just symptomatic, which comes with the risk of side effects. However, you should have Holter at regular intervals like yearly (with echo for aortic regurgitation), or if you notice sustained ectopics or irregular rhythm implying development of fibrillation. You may discuss changing Atenolol to others like Metoprolol and see if its help. You should try to identify triggers like sleep or gastric disturbances, alcohol or smoking (if any), any particular medications (which you are on), stress, etc. Also, if not had recently, thyroid should be tested. So in a nutshell, antiarrhythmics may be avoided, but if not tolerable symptomatically then may be tried. I hope this helps.

Please clarify, whether the pain is prominent feature or inability to move the arm, or is it like that she is not able to move arm because of pain or fear of pain. Now, this is not indicative of heart disease. Left arm pain without chest pain is unlikely to be related to the heart. Also, there would not be any difficulty in moving the arm with a heart attack. So it is unlikely to be related to the heart. The possibilities are, one is cervical and second is shoulder problems like frozen shoulder, or arm dislocation, even if there is no history of obvious trauma (frozen shoulder is more lifely).

Well, you see the abdominal pain in such age is often an alarming finding, and I urge you to get him some investigations before giving any blanket cover of medicines. Common possibilities in his age are: 1. Mesenteric ischemia, which is the narrowing of the blood vessel supplying the blood to abdominal organs. This can frequently occur in old age with diabetes and hypertension. The pain arises because of lack of blood supply to organs like small bowel, large bowel, and others. 2. The second possibility is pain due to any organ within the abdomen which is inflamed commonly the pancreas (a gland over the back of the tummy), and large bowel. 3.

As you have not mentioned the date of your last menstrual period, I am assuming by day 0 you mean the starting date of last menstrual cycle. Because we calculate the pregnancy age from that date. So yes, the early pregnancy time is very important because the embryo is developing in that time period. So as per your query, as you mentioned the consumption of wine in the early three weeks, I do not think it is gonna have any effect on the embryo because it is in the preovulatory phase when even the egg is being formed and released. And yes, corticosteroid in high doses when used for chronic medical conditions can have a risk of cleft lip and palate, but a single shot taken for an allergic reaction should not be affecting the baby. Also, the Flucloxacillin is a penicillin group of drug which is usually safe in pregnancy. So be calm and stop worrying about the risks. It will just increase your stress levels. Moreover in early pregnancy, if any embryo is grossly affected by any insult, it either usually aborts early if the exposure has been hazardous, but if the exposure is nonhazardous, it makes through and the baby will be fine. This is called all or none phenomenon in pregnancy. So your exposure to the medications was not that is something very dangerous, so rest assured.

Do I need to extract tooth in upper jaw to get braces?', 'Doctor': 'Hello. I went through your query and the attached image (attachment removed to protect patient identity). You have two lower second premolars extracted with no third molars in the lower jaw. Little bit crowding is seen in both upper lateral incisors that might be the reason for you opting for braces. Well, as a specialist upper tooths have a little bit of space in between the central incisors. Upper front teeth need proximal slicing to facilitate space that space will be enough to realign your both upper lateral to the arch. Although it is just a front profile if possible upload a side profile of your face to evaluate the overjet but I can say just marginal and proximal slicing of the upper front teeth will be enough, and no further extraction needed. Meanwhile, you have missing both lower second premolars. Get a fixed bridge to cover the gaps or else they will shift and get malaligned. Upper third molar are also fine and does not need extraction in the near future. Go for normal braces instead of Invisalign. Normal braces work much better in these cases.  I hope this helps.

Some continue to have breakouts even later in their life especially if there are some underlying hormonal issues or genetic predisposition. Pimples develop because of increased sebum secretion, inflammation, and bacteria residing on the skin called P. acnes has an important role to play. Treatment requires knowing your detailed history, any hormonal issues, any treatments you have taken in the past, products you use on your face, etc. Oral medicines and creams/gels are used for the treatment of acne. For mild eruptions, creams containing Clindamycin and Nicotinamide may be used. Benzoyl peroxide and Adapalene are other commonly prescribed anti-acne applications. But it is important to discuss with a dermatologist to decide on the correct line of treatment. Meanwhile, eat healthily, avoid excess milk and dairy, chocolates, and junk food. Exercise regularly and sleep well. Also, avoid using oil or greasy applications on the scalp and face and keep cosmetic use to a minimum.

However in future with weight loss and healthy lifestyle like avoiding fatty oily and high calorie food, plenty of green vegetables and fruits etc. his requirement for antihypertensive may go down. So his future BP readings would guide regarding that, but as of now he should be on regular BP medications with regular BP monitoring. Best BP readings would be 110 to 130 systolic and less than 90 diastolic. Now regarding Ecg and echo, firstly they are all hypertensive changes and not worrisome. Concentric LVH would be there even if BP is under control and it's not going to cause any problems. ECG doesn't show complete RBBB, however there are early RBBB changes which are again likely related to hypertension and not worrisome. Sinus arrhythmia is normal finding and nothing to worry to about prolonged P wave. So there are changes which are not very significant and alarming.

This is very classical of cardiac pain if it persists for a few minutes and does not last round the clock more than 1-2 days. Now if the pain does not have such characteristic then it may either be related to cervical spondylosis or gastric reflux. If you have any bloating, burping, heartburn, or upper abdominal pain, then it may be related to gastric reflux.

You should also have Betadine gargles four times a day for five days. Presence of pus does mean it is likely a bacterial infection, may not be strep but other bacterias. Now regarding the preventive aspect, firstly there is no reliable way of preventing it other than tonsillectomy. So you should consider this option if this is becoming troublesome for you. Now some points which would help to catch the infection are maintaining hand and oral hygiene, avoiding too cold foods which usually precipitates the infection. You should try to identify the triggers which have precipitated the infection last time like cold foods, street foods, or other triggers. You should consider the use of Chlorhexidine mouth wash on a regular basis. Next thing, you should have Betadine gargles with you. With the earliest symptoms of sore throat, you should start gargling four times a day which would prevent the progression to frank infection.

In most cases, it goes away over time and no treatment is needed. You can do some investments like CBC (complete blood count), urine R/M/E, RBS (random blood sugar), lipid profile, USG of W/A, PSA, etc and hormonal tests such as testosterone, LH, prolactin, thyroid function test, etc., to find out the underlying the causes which are responsible for your present sufferings and then treat them accordingly.  \", 'Patient': 'Hello doctor, I am a 32-year-old male.

My husband has fever for 10 days and abdominal pain while passsing stools. What is his problem?', 'Doctor': \"Hello. I feel very sorry to hear about your husband, and very rightly understand your concern and temptation for his unresolving symptoms. You are perfectly right that if treatment were given rightly he should have shown some improvement but unfortunately he did until now. So considering all the information you provided to me, there are few possibilities. First of all, is typhoid fever which is a bacterial infection. The second is intestinal amebiasis which is a parasitic infection. Typhoid seems to be likely possibly given his almost 10 days of fever, and in second week, he started to develop abdominal pain which is suggestive of typhoid ulcers in small bowel. I would suggest him an antibiotic course for at least 10 days, and a maximum of 14 days which would cover both potential bugs. I also want that you get him some blood and stool tests before starting antibiotic course. The antibiotic course is relatively safe. I also want that you closely examine his chest for the development of rose spots. They are very small pinkish marks which develop among patient over the chest in the second week of the illness. Do not worry they are harmless, it is just a manifestation. I really hope his symptoms will improve like a fever would start settle, and abdominal pain should resolve in the next 48 to 72 hours of the start of the antibiotic regimen. I would also want to know the assessment/prescription of a previous doctor who said about colopathy. The colopathy is a very broad and vague term which means colon (large bowel) inflammation. It has a number of causes the one is painkillers (NSAIDs) and recently COVID 19 has shows some case reports with colopathy. But if your family and he himself does not have any contact history to COVID 19 positive or suspected case, then the possibility is very rare. Ultrasound is not a sensitive investigation for the disease which involves the bowel lumen such as in your husband's case. Ultrasound is more helpful in disease involving liver, spleen, or gall bladder. So it is not uncommon to have a normal ultrasound with conditions like typhoid fever or intestinal amebiasis. So I am writing him antibiotics for 10 days now if the improvement is shown we would increase up to 14 days. I really hope with this course his symptoms will start settling in the next 48 to 72 hours.

Since the fever has dropped and it does not exceed 37.7 (so he continues to take Paracetamol) but for the past week he has been suffering from abdominal pain more precisely below the navel. So we went back to see the same doctor two days ago, who gave him an ultrasound that showed nothing abnormal. He diagnosed a colopathy but I have the impression that this diagnosis is wrong. He started this treatment that same day but until today there is no improvement. He still suffers from abdominal pain especially after going to the bathroom and fever although low (maximum 37.7 °) got as high as 38.8 tonight, no more diarrhea but little constipation.

The orthopedic doctor did not diagnose it but referred him to a general doctor who again did not diagnose it but said there is pus buildup inside the foot and it needs surgery. My father who accompanied my brother asked the doctor whether it will subside with medicines or if surgery is needed. The doctor simply said you can use the medicine or you can do the surgery. I am out of the country and feel the doctor may have not specified the situation correctly to my father and also may have not clearly explained why he suggested the surgery. I needed a second opinion, as I want my brother to receive proper treatment and identify if it is a serious condition and I need to know the best solution.

CT KUB (kidneys, ureter, and bladder) is 95% accurate to diagnose urinary stones. Usually, stones form in the kidney and drop down the ureter causing extreme pain due to stretch of the renal capsule. Since your right kidney is blocked, I need to check on your kidney functions by doing a blood test called creatinine level, especially if you have other medical problems like diabetes or hypertension. I also want to make sure you do not have urinary infections after this if kidney functions are normal and no infection then we can try medical therapy for 4-6 weeks with capsule Tamsulosin (Contiflo) 0.4 mg at night daily for six weeks the possibility of passing the stone is 25%. If you need more urgent treatment with a 70% stone clearance rate will be shock wave lithotripsy. If you got pain again in spite of medication or you got high creatinine level then endoscopic ureteroscopy DJ stent will be the best first-line option. On follow up after treatment you need needs calcium level, phosphate, and uric acid. I hope this helps. Creatinine, urine analysis, and culture. Hydration lemon and orange fresh juices.

Is it possible to get upper abdominal pain due to peptic ulcer?', 'Doctor': 'Hello. Well the pain which comes in or worsen after doing physical movements is highly likely secondary to muscle and bone related. The pain of peptic ulcer however can be knawing and usually worsens after meals. But given the fact that you have been using Omeprazole which is a strong acid suppressant, is helpful in healing peptic ulcer; the presence of peptic ulcers in your stomach seems to be a rare possibility.  1. I suggest you to take tablet Orphanderine plus Paracetamol combination one tablet three times daily for a few days and avoid doing heavy lifting or any thing that you think will worsen the pain; and see how does it go.  2. If your pain does not solve then I suggest you to increase the Omeprazole dose to 40 mg twice daily half an hour before meals. This would certainly improve the pain if it secondary to peptic ulcer disease.  Lastly there are other conditions which tend to cause pain which worsen with excercise and bearing weight and one such condition is called nerve entrapment pain.

If you have documented UTI before and you got treated then you have pus cells and white cells in urine, your test might have been performed soon after antibiotics.

How to fix my problem?', 'Doctor': 'Hi. From the information given it seems you are experiencing the early signs of male pattern hair loss. This is a very common condition and there are many factors responsible, one of them being genetic. If you have other family members with similar patterned hair loss the chances for you to develop it increase too. Due to the effect of the male hormone on the hair cycle, over a period of time, the hair follicle starts shrinking and so the hair which comes out is thinner and more fragile and breaks easily. Also, the growing phase of the hair is shortened, so your hair does not grow as long it used to and becomes shorter and wispier. Being just 17 years old I am sure it must be worrying you a lot. But do not be disheartened. There are several treatment options available and the sooner we start the treatment the better the chances of reducing further hair loss, thinning, and increasing regrowth. A combination of oral supplements to boost hair growth along with application of lotions containing Minoxidil 5% to begin with will be the best course of action in my opinion. Oral Finasteride, which is the male hormone blocker, is used frequently. Applications with Finasteride are available too. This will be prescribed by your treating doctor after assessing the extent of thinning and discussing the side effects, etc. Several preparations of bio-peptides and other natural ingredients like saw palmetto extract, melatonin, etc are also available to boost the hair growth. PRP (platelet-rich plasma) is a popular procedure which is often used in combination with medical treatment to stimulate hair growth further. Usually, a combination of treatments is suggested after the clinical evaluation. But using the applications regularly is the key to good results. Hair regrowth takes a few months to show and you will have to be patient to see the benefit of the treatment. I hope this helps.  ', 'Patient': 'Hi doctor,  I am a 17-year-old male.

I can imagine the level of your frustration regarding your weight. Yes, it is nearly impossible to keep reduce weight and maintain diet and exercise. I may not be able to give you a composite plan of action for your weight reduction since it is not basically a one day consultation task. In fact, it is a long term commitment towards yourself and towards a multidisciplinary team inclusive of a dietician, bariatric endoscopist (gastroenterologist), behavioral therapist, and lastly a bariatric surgeon. So I would give you facts and figures for the existing evidence of weight reduction therapies. Remember your current body mass index BMI is 34.3. The goal of any weight reduction treatment is to reduce weight to optimal ranges where the physical and psychological well being of a person is maintained. Now anybody whose body mass index (BMI) is more than 40 should straight away consider bariatric intervention in the form of endoscopic or surgical modality. And anybody whose BMI is 35 but having other conditions such as uncontrolled diabetes, coronary artery disease (heart disease) or lung dysfunction (lung hypertension and sleep disorders) should undergo interventions. But you see not all person fit into above category. Many have BMI less than 35 (such as in your case) and having very troubling symptoms, among such people individualized approach is employed whether medicinal use or endoscopic or surgical intervention. Diets and regular weight reduction exercises do help to reduce weight by 7 to 10%. All medicines which are currently in use help reduce weight by 10 to 20%. Certain endoscopic bariatric procedures such as balloon placement in stomach and sleeve gastrectomy does help reduce weight around 25% And lastly, surgical procedures such as metallic rings around the stomach via laparoscopy and surgical sleeve gastrectomy, and surgical Roux Y bypass, help to reduce weight by 30 to 35%. The figures are ranges, they vary significantly in individual cases. I also want you to understand, that these interventions should be accompanied with optimal dieting and exercise even after surgery or medicinal therapy. Otherwise, the weight can frequently recur to original ones. This above description is only to make you understand and figure out things. I can recommend you to start with dieting (keeping your calories well below 1500 Kcal daily), running, swimming, and weight lifting on a regular basis. I also suggest you to meet a dietician on icliniq or otherwise in person, to get a diet plan with respect to your calorie requirement. I can suggest you some medicinal treatment, but they are prescription medicine, may not be OTC, and the course has to be taken for at least six months to see the effect. Naltrexone/Bupropion (Contrave) is proven and FDA approved and can be started in your case. But I want you to provide more information about your health, as I can assess your condition first and treat aimfully rather adding more harm to your health. Because these medications have some side effects and they should be kept in mind before giving it therapeutically. I also want to know about family support, any occupational therapist available near your vicinity, your current job status, and medical health insurance, and also information whether the cost of these medicines is covered or not. Until that time you follow up, I want you to get the following blood tests to better know the impact of your obesity on bodily systems. I hope this helps. Obesity. Complete blood count. TSH (thyroid-stimulating hormone), FT3, FT4. Liver function test. Fasting lipid profile. Serum CRP (C-reactive protein). Albumin total protein and AG ratio. Arterial blood gases.

According to your statement, you have been suffering from clogged earaches with painful jaw joints and sore throat with vertigo and all these sufferings may result from herpes infection according to your assumption. When herpes affects the nerve in the face that spreads to ear known as Herpes zoster oticus its clinical features are severe earaches, swelling of vestibular nerve, fluid-filled vesicles on outside of ear and inside ear canal, permanent or temporary paralysis of the face with hearing loss. Again herpes esophagitis can attack the mouth. Sores may develop in the mouth and make swelling difficult due to inflammation of the throat. This pain can radiate to mouth and jaws. Sudden hearing loss can result commonly from viral infections other than herpes are measles, mumps, rubella, viral meningitis, syphilis, AIDS, etc., which can cause sudden loss of hearing. Again bacterial meningitis, Lyme, any tumors in the ear can also be hearing loss. Any type of hearing loss, steroid should be applied immediately.

How will Melatonin interact with the effect of birth control pills?', 'Doctor': 'Hello. I understand your concern here and you are right that there are not many or in fact hardly any articles or peer-reviewed papers on Melatonin and birth control interactions. But I would like to keep it simple for you to understand. Melatonin is produced during the night to ease the sleep pattern in humans post-sunset with maximum levels at 9 PM and by morning 9 AM, the levels found are almost negligible. So, it is produced by the pineal gland in the dark cycle and metabolized at night by the liver. Now liver also is known to metabolize the birth control pills be it progesterone-only or combinations pills. Hence, if taken together then there is a likelihood of slower metabolism of either compound and thereby prolonged residual effect may be seen on concurrent use of pills and Melatonin together. The effects could be prolonged sleepiness and also Melatonin induced increased progesterone levels in the body causing bloating and noticeable progestogenic side effects. However, the efficacy or effectiveness of the pill is not compromised but metabolism is delayed as Melatonin competes with the pill with the liver. So ideally the better way would be to switch the POP in the morning hours and the Melatonin pill at night 12 hours apart. This would prevent any interference with either action on the body or cause any interaction.  ', 'Patient': 'Hello doctor, I have read that Melatonin could possibly lessen the effectiveness of birth control pills. My understanding is that there is little to no peer-reviewed scientific studies to support this claim, but I am still worried, as I am sexually active and take 3 mg of Melatonin each night (and I am on the progestin-only pill). I am looking for a doctor to weigh in on this issue.'}, {'id': 89, 'Description': 'Q. I have pain in pelvic area during intercourse with a history of UTI. Please help.', 'Doctor': 'Hello. It is important in your case to rule out the possibility of pelvic inflammatory disease. Now points in favor are history of chlamydia and UTI in the past, pain on deep penetration and tenderness on the left side of abdomen. These are the sufficient point to evaluate for the possibility of PID (pelvic inflammatory disease). I guess you do not have any discharge per vaginum may be scanty. One more thing is, just try to see if you are having this pain from the beginning from the intercourse or started after some time. Because if it is from the beginning then this may be dyspareunia and not related to PID. But if it has developed later then it becomes important that you undergo evaluation for PID. You will need an ultrasound of pelvis, CRP (C-reactive protein) or ESR (erythrocyte sedimentation rate), vaginal fluid smear. However, the vaginal examination will also be helpful to see whether there is any cervical motion tenderness, which would give a fair idea about the possibility. It is important to rule out PID because it can have consequences later like fertility issues. So if we get any clues regarding it then you will need a course of antibiotic treatment. I hope this helps.  ', 'Patient': 'Hello doctor, I only have one sexual partner for almost a year.

Headache which is throbbing in nature may result from the dilation of blood vessels from increased blood flow. Headache is very common in everyone life.

Throbbing headaches may result from some health conditions such as migraines.

I get bloody semen with clots and pain in my right testicle. What is my problem?', 'Doctor': 'Hello. Hematospermia (blood in semen), is fairly common. Generally it is not considered as a sinister sign. There are whole list of possibilities for this theoretically, but once we ensure it is not due to sinister cause and rule out treatable causes say like infections we do not beyond that as it will not affect the management. Sinister causes mainly prostate and testicular cancers. At your age prostate cancer is extremely unlikely but need to ensure no testicular problem. With your symptoms with testes, you need another scan to be on safe side as the scope for examination to be conclusive. I suspect you have epidydimal cysts which are very common and can cause pain, etc. So if the scan does not show anything other than this, I would not worry about it at all. I think the rash is completely unrelated to this or any of your urological problems. Nor the rash or hematospermia is related to old history of chlamydia. Since you have not had any other urinary symptom, I would not worry much about other tests related to urinary tract. However, I would also recommend sending semen for culture to see any infection in it. Lastly about prostate cancer virtually unheard in your age. Finger examination of prostate, PSA blood test and MRI scans of prostate are the screening tests in general. But not something I would recommend if testes scan comes back normal and if you are still worried an MRI then will be helpful as last resort. Idiopathic. Testicular pathology. Ultrasound scan of testes. Ideally an examination of genitals including prostate by a clinician. Semen culture. Idiopathic. Hematospermia. With reports.

First of all, I need to know some more detailed points. Where exactly in the wrist the shot was given? I mean is it the extensors of the thumb (de quervain) or is it for any other finger? Also, do you have thyroid issues? Sometimes when the large volume of fluid is injected into the tendon sheath and surrounding area, due to distension it can cause severe pain and patients do complain of exaggerated symptoms prior to injection. Small vessels must have been punctured (quite normal) which lead to extravasation of blood hence the bruise. It will take a few more days, but both the bruise and the bump should go away. Do apply ice packs there you will get you the necessary relief. Ganglion cysts are notorious for recurrence but highly unlikely to be associated or related to the injection.

My father passes stools whenever he gets an urge to pass urine and antibiotics did not help. Why?', 'Doctor': \"Hello, Welcome you to icliniq.com. I can understand you must be very concerned about your father's health. Well I have reviewed his medical history, which he has been taking for hypertension, prostate, and recent use of antibiotics and Imodium. So typical symptom you mention that whenever he urges to pass urine, stools passes by itself which is suggestive of stool incontinence-means loss of control stools. With his age, it is possible that he has weak anal sphincter. The anal sphincter is a muscle around the anus which contracts and control the stool output. In older age, it become weak and lack sustained contraction hence get loosened. With every attempt to pass urine, which increases abdominal pressure, would also lead to evacuation of stools. This stool incontinence because of loose sphincter at times perceived as diarrhea, however, it is not actual diarrhea. For diarrhea, once has to have stool volume more than 200 ml/24 hour, and significant change in consistency of stools like watery stools, or greenish unformed stools containing food particles. If none of these signs which are suggestive of diarrhea I suggest you to stop Ofloxacin if given for perceived diarrhea. The drug he has been taking for prostate also causes external anal sphincter and hence partly contribute to his stool incontinence. I want to know if he is feeling mucus (thick jelly like material) in stools, blood in stools or rectal pain, or repeated visits to toilet when nothing comes out? This information is important to rule out any inflammatory process beside loose anal sphincter. I suggest you few investigation for stool studies, which will tell if he has active infection of bowel and if present can be treated with antibiotics then. For treatment he can take Imodium, two tablets thrice daily for two more days. Excessive use of this medication would cause constipation and can worsen patient discomfort. I want you to help him learn pelvic muscle strengthening exercises. There are many youtube videos available to learn how to do pelvic floor strengthening exercises while sitting on a common chair. Lastly biofeedback therapy which is a computerized software which help him to control his anal sphincter while passing urine or otherwise. This treatment is offered at physiotherapy department of a hospital. Avoid excessive fibers and modify liquids (1 to 1.5 liter maximum) intake in a day. This would reduce the overall bulk of stools formation in the bowel and hence decreased stool output. Stop or reduce alcohol intake if taking. This also causes diarrhea and loose sphincter controls. I hope this helps. Stool incontinence secondary to age with loose sphincter, plus drug side effect. Digital rectal examination (performed by gastroenterologist in person). Norectal manometry (not usually required if digital rectal examination is suggestive of the diagnosis). Stool detail report. Stool fecal calprotecin and  stool for occult blood. Stool for ova and parasites. Stool for fat globules and reducing substance. Complete blood count. Stool incontinence secondary to older age and drug-related.

Is there any numbness in the leg, does the leg feel weak apart from the pain you feel while trying to walk, can you control your bladder well ,does the pain worsen upon straining ? If the answer to the questions is yes then you have a disc prolapse and you will need to see a doctor and perhaps a MRI too.

Usually tri dot HIV test is able to rule out HIV after six weeks of exposure. However, HIV test can be considered conclusive in ruling out HIV after three month of exposure.

There is nothing that you need to worry about as this is extremely common. Make sure you do not use earbuds as they often traumatize the ear canal or eardrum and introduce infections. Please do not use headphones or earphones as well, until it heals. Make sure you keep the ear dry, make sure no water enters the ear at any cost. For now you can apply Ciplox (Ciprofloxacin) ear drops three drops thrice a day and take tablet LCZ (Levocetirizine) 10 mg one tablet at night after meals for the next one week (this will reduce any itching). Make sure that there is no pus like discharge from the ear because in such a situation, the infection of the eardrum is more likely and will require systemic oral antibiotics. I hope this helps.

Reviewing your history and pictures showed (attachment removed to protect patient identity), there might be skin irritation which can be from repeated frictions like masturbation or reaction to the substance used it also can be due to vitamin deficiency or a skin condition like psoriasis, etc. Fungal infection is rare and it does not present as a spot usually it is whitish material and happens in people who are immune compromised like diabetics or people who have HIV infections. Since it is not itchy or painful you should not worry about it and you should not use Cortisone cream as it makes things worse. Keep good hygiene area should be dry and clean. Use nonchemical lubricant like olive oil if you masturbate. If you have changed your soap or shower gel it might be the cause. Take vitamin E and vitamin A to replace your vitamin deficiency.

A personal question: But is there a particular reason for the depression? Any family history for endogenous depression?  There can be many reasons of pain.

I have gone through the results you attached (attachment removed to protect patient identity). You are experiencing missed beats aslo known as premature ventricular contractions. They are are usually benign (harmless). Your symptoms can be worsened by drinking, caffeine, smoking or some medications. I usually do not prescribe my patients medication at first except it affects your daily activity. Firstly, avoid trigerrs like alcohol, drugs, sleeplessness, etc. Try to exercise regularly. Atleast 3 or 4 times a week. For a duration of 30 minutes. Make sure to sleep 6 to 7 hours daily at night. If your symptoms persist, you will need a Beta-Blocker medication. It acts by regulating how your heart beats. Ablation is the definite treatment of choice if all measures fail but am hopeful it will not get to that. I wish you good health. Best regards.  ', 'Patient': 'Hi doctor,  I am 21 years old and having regular single heart palpations. I have an Apple Watch which provides an ECG and this shows my heart is beating at regular intervals, but there is fairly regularly a single beat which is much larger. I can feel this in my stomach/chest area and feels like a heavy beat or a missed beat. I will upload a couple of PDF results to show you. You can quite clearly see when these large beats take place. I sometimes get chest pain but I usually attribute this to my stomach or anxiety, and the chest pain does not tend to accompany the heart palpitation. My main worry is it is quite regularly happening and it is one singular beat which is ‘off’. I have bad bloating which has been for the last month or two which comes and goes, but am unsure if this is related.'}, {'id': 127, 'Description': 'Q. How can large tooth cavity be treated?', 'Doctor': 'Hello. As a human we all carry some kinds of secrets or fear back in our head. I felt glad as you have the courage to admit that, most people cannot. So be proud of that. I think you need a scaling too, as you have not brushed for a long time its leads to swollen gingiva that might be the reason of uncomfortable using a brush. As you have caries and sensitivity associated, you might not necessarily need an extraction. If the caries has progressed alot, root canal can be done to save your tooth. Betadine Mouthwash, Gargle in lukewarm water 2-3 times a day. Do not worry, use it, if any foul breath that will be covered and your secret will be safe. As you feel uncomfortable using a brush, you can brush using your finger and toothpaste. That way your mouth will also be clean and issue with bristle will also be resolved. You can also take capsule Sporidex 500 mg one apsule BD for 5 days, tablet Zerodol SP 1 tablet BD for 5 days, capsule Pan D one capsule BD before meal for 5 days. You will be needing a scaling to remove any tartar. Once done you can start practising brushing using a soft bristle brush (even a baby brush will do for a start). I am confident you will succeed. But you have to start the habit and you will get used to it, trust me. You can train and motivate yourself by rewarding a candy or anything special. By that way you can overcome your fear and gain comfidence. I am glad that I could be someone whom you can share a secret. I wish you good luck. You can trust me and ask if any further query. I will be happy to help further. Hope your treatment goes fine. Do as I asked you to do. You are brave, you will be fine. I am confident about that.

Do not worry about the periods, as you are aware that delay in periods can be due to obesity as you had suffered last time, however my compliments to you for reducing 14 kg of weight (attachment removed to protect patient identity), so we can conclude that delay is not due to being overweight. Then delay can be due to hormonal changes due to various medications specially birth control pills, etc., which you are not taking. Stress is also one of the major reasons these days due to Corona and associated problems. Pregnancy can be a reason but only if one is sexually active, and you are out of that risk as well.

First, let me appreciate you for describing whatever your child has appropriately. As you have said that the baby has just started walking about 5 months ago, the problem with balance could be just his learning curve. Kids normally do fall while learning to walk, am sure even you will be aware of that. He is able to walk, rule and climb stairs only means he is growing normally.  Now, to say if the balancing issue is normal or not you can make a small video of it and show me. It is difficult to say without seeing the baby. Let us assume that it is a part of normal development, then you do not have to go to a doctor and you do not have to worry about it. Now, if we assume that it could be because of a physical problem, the child will have to be examined. My advise is to wait till he completes 2 years. If the problem still persists, then you have to go to a doctor.  ', 'Patient': 'Hello doctor,  Age of the child: 20 Months  Gender: Male  Weight: 12 Kilograms  Height: 30 inches  Started Walking: 15 Months  Started Sitting: 5 months  Started Crawling: 12 months  Problem:  My baby has started walking at the age of 15 months and is very active. He runs, jumps, rolls, and can climb stairs with the help of an adult. And can speak 2 words sentences. The problem we are facing is a balance issue. He is an active child but has an issue in maintaining good posture and is easy to fall. When standing straight and static an observer can feel that he is dizzy and swings slightly left and right to maintain the balance. He also has lazy neck control. At 2 months of age he suffered from “Torticollis” which we have managed to minimize by exercises recommended by other pediatrics. He also has digestion problems since birth and has loose motion after 1 week. He has also slight drooling. My question: Is this balance probelm common in this age group or should we choose to consult an in-person doctor which I am avoiding due to COVID-19 crisis as the hospitals are crowded.'}, {'id': 130, 'Description': 'Q. What causes pain in throat while singing high notes?', 'Doctor': 'Hi. I treat a lot of singers, so I totally understand what you are going through. To answer your first question, yes it is totally possible to diagnose based on an audio clip of you singing (attachment removed to protect patient identity), though a better method would be a scopy of your voice box. However, I am guessing there are breaks or voice gaps in certain parts when you hit a high note. This is common among male singers. The issue here is that your voice box has 2 vocal cords that vibrate when you sing. The slightest inflammation or irregularity in these vocal cords can produce noticeable changes in a singers voice. The problem here is that the slightest change in the singing voice makes the singer more anxious and he tends to practice harder. Doctors typically prescribe steroids, but that will not help unless you give your voice a rest. Give the vocal cords enough time to heal. There is a lot more I would like to say, but I will try and summarize my advice for you.  1. Total voice rest for 7 days. No speaking, no whispering.  2. Daily concentrated salt water gargles.  3. Steroids (Betnesol) 0.5 mg 2 times a day for 5 days.  4. Pantoprazole 40 every morning for 7 days.  5. After 7 days, try afresh and record the audio, I would love to hear the before and after.  Hope you become a star singer one day.  ', 'Patient': 'Hello doctor, I am a singer, but in recent times, I have not been able to sing high pitch. I develop pain in my throat while singing high notes.

My 6-year-old daughter has visible blood vessels on tonsils with no symptoms. Is it a matter of concern?', 'Doctor': 'Hi. I have had a look at the pictures you have sent (attachment removed to protect patient identity). The tonsils are definitely enlarged in this case, there is no doubt about it. The tonsils have a very rich blood supply and are relatively avascular structure. It is normal to encounter leash of blood vessels over the tonsil or its adjacent areas like the anterior and posterior pillars (these are two walls in between which the tonsils reside). Unless and until the tonsils are inflamed and the child is symptomatic, we do not need to give any sort of antibiotics as it is not indicated. At the same point of time, enlarged tonsil indicates possible previous episodes of recurrent tonsillitis as a result of which the tonsillar tissues get hypertrophied and attains a larger size. It is always better to maintain strict oral hygiene, do saltwater gargles five to six times a day at regular intervals. Avoid anything cold, spicy, and oily food/beverages. Maintaining precautionary measures definitely goes a long way in preventing recurrent sore throats or streptococcal infections. However, in a situation where the child is having recurrent sore throats with associated fever, significant leaves from school, it is always better to get the tonsils removed. There are criteria given by aao-hns (American association of otorhinolaryngologists and head and neck surgeons) who have laid down criteria for a patient to undergo tonsillectomy. In nutshell, visible blood vessels over the tonsils or related adjacent structures is not a worry as it is very common and seen in health and have not pathology related to it. Sticking of the uvula to the right tonsil is due to surface tension of the saliva and enlarged size of the tonsil. This again has no clinical significance. There is absolutely nothing that you need to worry or get stressed about. Make sure you advise the child to follow the instructions that I have given above to prevent recurrent sore throats. In addition, she can also use crushed ginger with manuka honey (you can add crushed ginger and honey in a cup and give it together one tablespoon three times a day). Honey has excellent antioxidant, antiviral, antibacterial properties and so does ginger. I hope this helps.

This information is important because only SGPT which is just nearly one and a half times raised cannot tell a diagnosis on its own. To answer your concern that it is harmful? yes it is, but whether it is less harmful or highly harmful, that depends upon the underlying condition. The causes of such raised SGPT are many folds.

Well, the pain you mention that is severe and radiating to back is suggestive of pancreatitis. However, the possibility of peptic ulcers cannot be completely ruled out. Ideally, the pancreatitis that is inflammation of the pancreas (a gland at the back of tummy) should be managed in the hospital. However, the pain of ulcers (peptic ulcers) in the stomach and small bowel can be managed at home. But before making a diagnosis it is required that you provide further history about her pain. Did she have this before? And if yes, how long it last? Did she frequently have heartburn or acidity issues? Is she on some medications right now? You mentioned her age, what is her marital status? Did she have fever? or yellowish eyes? or dark yellow eyes? You mention she has yellowish vomiting, but is she able to take orally or she is throwing up everything like water or food that you give to her? You see all this information can help us to decide the most probable cause of the underlying pain and consider some treatment to see the response. For time being, you can give her capsule Esomeprazole 4o mg now and half hour before meals. Expect the reduction in pain if it is due to peptic ulcer disease. The pain of pancreatitis will not settle with this capsule. If she is unable to take orally, then you can visit a nearby nursing clinic and get IV Omeprazole 40 mg. Pancreatitis.

If less than five minutes, it is not significant. This particular sound you are describing can be caused due to dysfunctional eustachian tube, i.e. the tube connecting the ear and the nose. Usually, it is more in quiet environments and more noticeable when you are attempting to fall asleep. Crowded and noisy places serve as a distraction and do not let you notice the sound. Medicines do work, but it takes at least a month for them to act, that too the sound does not vanish until two to three months have gone by. I understand the trouble it is causing you. So what is to be done? 1. Keep a table fan for white noise when you are trying to fall asleep. 2. Try and distract yourself when you hear the sound. 3. Get a hearing test done.

Will it be an issue in my visa medical test?', 'Doctor': 'Hello. I had gone through all the details posted. The difference in size of the testicles is mainly because of two reasons, orchitis and hydrocele. Orchitis is inflammation of the testicles, which has happened three years back due to mumps. There will be redness, pain and no fluid around the testis. For decrease of swelling and pain, we need to use anti-inflammatory agents. If there is any bacterial infection, then we need to use antibiotics. In case of hydrocele, if the inflammation is more, then the fluid will be formed around the testis, which needs ultrasound and clinical examination for diagnosis. If there is fluid around the testis, then it can be removed by surgery. If you have hydrocele, there is chance for rejection to foreign countries. So, you may need to be operated. If it is only different size of the testis and no fluid, then there may not be a chance for rejection. So, you need to consult a general surgeon and get an ultrasound of the scrotum for further management.

Well yes there is some pus, but the large part of the wound is healthy and pink. It is not uncommon to have pus few days after the surgery. The treatment you are taking are rightly prescribed, but I did not know the dose of amoxicillin which is a antibiotic. If you are taking under dose, I suggest you to take 1 gm twice daily (total of 2000 mg daily). You can simply take a guaze peice and wipe down the pus which is coming. It is highly possible that this pus will dry in coming few days. You can add Tab metronidazole 400 mg thrice daily for 7 days to help heal the infection. I also want to know do you have any other abdominal symptoms? such as abdominal pain, diarrhea, vomiting, or unusual weight loss? because it is important to know whether you have other problem within the bowel which is manifesting as anal fistula. It is however unusual to have fistula at such a young age.. I am here to discuss if you have the any above mentioned symptoms. Stay safe Anal fistula recently operated stool fro fecal calprotectin and stool detail report.

Yes, insulin might result in some weight gain, but if you are keeping a check on your calories and include a good amount of non-starchy food including whole grain, fresh whole fruits, and vegetables will help you to shed some fat. Keep a check on your exercise minutes, you can easily do 150 minutes of aerobic exercise per week which includes walking, bicycling, and other forms of moderate muscle strengthening exercises. Just keep in mind that your sugar level must not go down, do not reduce your insulin dosage. Also never skip a meal, if you skip a meal you will tend to indulge more calories in the next meal. Include more protein rich food, protein, and fiber rich meals will bring early satiety and will easily help build in more muscles than fat. I hope this helps.

So I started doing minimal resistance training and changed my eating habits for three weeks already. I noticed that my legs look leaner but my upper body is still the same. This made me anxious because it might have something to do with my insulin medications and I cannot go to an actual dietician since they were still on quarantine so I thought someone might be able to help me online.

However, if you have got him tested and it is negative, it is more likely to be allergic. If so, it is not possible to transfer the disease to you just by being in your proximity. If possible start him on antihistamines and nasal spray as soon as possible to relieve him of his symptoms. I will give you a prescription for the same.

If those past experiences were pleasurable one that there is innate wish to re-experience them and same is applicable for you. It can be said that this is normal to have fantasy to love and loved by someone who was very close to you. However, we need to keep track of society and changes that took place over the last four years. Since she is married it will be completely wrong for her to get associated with you in any romantic relationship. Since you love her, there is a good chance you will not push her in trouble. In case you push her in some different way that too create problems for her as well as you. At this stage it is important to do following.  1. Minimise the interaction with her through common friends and relatives. If possible avoid meeting her completely.  2. Engage yourself with productive work. Do not allow your brain to wander here and there.  3. Get married or in relationship if still single. This is most important part as other romantic relationship will distract you to the core needs of life and will also allow you to understand her situation.  4. Acknowledge that this is common emotion and you will try your level best to overcome it.  5. Discuss with your best friends about the situation and moral dilemmas, if possible.

Kindly advise.', 'Doctor': 'Hello. Your ECG is fine and sinus arrhythmia is normal phenomenon, where heart range varies with respiration. It may not be evident always or depends on sensitivity of machine, and also it is more pronounced, detectable when one is breathing heavily or rapidly. So it is not a matter of worry at all.  Next thing, were you also having palpitations when ECG was taken or subsided by that time? Because considering symptoms of palpitations and chest discomfort, its important to rule out possibility of cardiac arrhythmias like PSVT/ paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, which are intermittent and ECG would be absolutely normal at other time. So normal ECG does not rule out possibility of arrhythmia.  So you should either have holter monitoring (24 hour ECG monitoring, but it would detect arrhythmia only if it happened during this 24 hour period) or you can buy simple single lead ECG devices, which would help to monitor your rhythm whenever you are symptomatic. So, basically we need an ECG rhythm during symptoms so as to reliably rule out possibility of cardiac arrhythmia. In a nutshell, your ECG is fine and may need further steps. I would also like to know why are you eliquis, Prednisone. And thyroid problems may cause arrhythmia like atrial fibrillation, so TSH should be monitored.

Looking into your problem it seems you are badly in pain and looking for things can help you walk so you remember about crutches. As simple protocols use simple formula RICE rest, ice compression and elevation of your feet are key sutra.  For severe sprains, you might need a brace for protection and stability its good to use ankle brace having binder together in it. You may need crutches until you can walk without pain. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can help to control pain and swelling. We need to evaluate ankle with Grade II or Grade III sprains. Grade III sprains with complete tears of the ligaments even might need surgery to repair the injured ligaments. One thing to remember is that always in most cases, follow-up rehabilitative exercises are to restore strength and range of motion in the sprained ankle-also help to prevent future ankle injuries.

Mild increase of immature granulocytes and high count with neutrophilia could be due to infection or inflammation in the body. Your detailed physical examination and investigation should be done to find the underlying cause. For your complaint you can investigate further with ANA (antinuclear antibody) estimation, USG (ultrasound) abdomen, Vitamin D estimation, serum calcium estimation, blood pressure measurement, and blood sugar estimation. Your ear examination also should be done. Antibiotic courses can be prescribed as per the provided report. However, before that physical examination and above investigation can be done.

I can imagine your reason of concern for such ongoing on and off symptoms. Well first of all, if it were ulcerative or Crohn's disease it should have shown something abnormal on CT scan which I presume it did not. However, remember the CT scan reporting is completely a subjective thing. It depends highly on the expertise of radiologists who has reported that. I would urge if you upload the report in reply to this response, I would be glad to see that. There will be no charges for that I will allow you one free follow up. Now the presence of too many stools is not an uncommon finding on CT Scan. Since it is basically the function of the colon to reserve stools transit them timely in anterograde direction and finally to be evacuated through the rectum and anal canal. If the presence of stool with dilation of the lumen of colon or presence of stools within small bowel (fecalization of small bowel) and/or dilation of the lumen of small bowel suggest an alarming finding. Normally our small bowel does not usually contain stools, it rapidly empties matter to in to large bowel, hence the presence of stool in small bowel suggests an abnormal finding. I will tell you why this information on CT scan is important. For example, you have a normal size of the lumen of bowel (ideally less than 3 cm of small bowel and less than 5 cm of large bowel) with the symptoms you mention, it can be irritable bowel syndrome with constipation. If the diameter of the lumen is above the normal it can be functional constipation of which two further types. The one is chronic colonic constipation or colonic pseudo-obstruction called as Ogilvie's syndrome. The other where the small bowel is dilated called chronic small bowel pseudo obstruction. I hope you now have an idea why it is important to correlate symptoms with the CT scan findings. Now coming to your symptoms, the pain or discomfort is often common when bowel loops are distended with gas or stools and your discomfort which readily resolves after you have good bowel movements suggest the possibility of the same and not otherwise due to a serious underlying cause. The intensity of discomfort that changes with the bowel movement again suggests it might secondary to irritable bowel syndrome IBS. Metamucil is fiber laxative and really it does not have any harm if taken for years and years. The fiber is nonabsorbale molecule it does not go into blood circulation so have no side effects. However, in some it can cause bloating or belching. You can switch to other fibers such as Fibrocol if Metamucil does not suit you. Otherwise, it is completely normal if you want to resume the same. Take plenty of water it makes stool bulk large and soft and easy to pass. I myself have a habit of taking 3 liters of water in a day and this really makes wonder. You should continue that. I would wait for your CT scan report to see the findings then I will right you some investigations to rule out other possibilities. I believe you would not have anyone but just to be on the safe side.  \", 'Patient': \"Hi doctor, I have been having abdominal discomfort for a while. At first, the discomfort was in the flank portion. I went to a urologist he gave me muscle relaxers and a few tablets for clearing any small stones. The discomfort went away after taking the medication. But after some days may be due to sex or workout am not sure, the discomfort returned back. I went to the doctor again he suggested a CT scan. CT scan results showed a lot of stools in the bowel. He said to maintain a healthy diet and add more water and fiber and do some exercises if the problem persists he asked to check with the general practitioner. I had an appointment with my family physician who said the discomfort can be due to lack of bowel movements in the colon. He asked me to take a fiber supplement (Metamucil) after taking it I had clean bowel movements and I felt I was relieved. Of late, I stopped taking the fiber supplement for a couple of days I started having hard stools. Again I called up the doctor, he said no harm in taking Metamucil. So I started it again and drinking at least three liters of water. I am doing like he said to have clean bowel movements. Sometimes the discomfort switches sides left or right. At times my backache as well. I told the doctor and he said it can be chronic constipation can go for many days. I sense my stomach or colon may getting inflamed as the day goes by.

I get my period every month and I have lost weight with the Metformin. I went in for a follow up today and my doctor recommended that I sign up for an infertility study that she is doing. It requires hormone shots, extensive testing and in vitro fertilization every month for a period of four months. I have been going to the same gynecologist for many years and I know her pretty well. Let me just say that she has never seemed like she puts much thought into diagnosing and treating me. I had to practically beg her to test me for PCOS even though I have had very irregular periods and other symptoms for years. Now, she jumped straight to IVF treatment. I have heard of women staying on this course of treatment much longer and being able to conceive. In vitro is incredibly expensive. I am just worried that the only reason she recommended this is because she wants another participant in her study. Your advice on this subject would be appreciated.

Since it is extensive it is important to start proper treatment with oral antifungals for a good length of time to clear the infection. You have been using steroid creams which is going to worsen the infection and make it spread further. So you should stop using dipsalic and other steroid applications and start proper treatment. You should get your LFT and KFT done and you can follow up with dermatologist. Usually itraconazole or terbinafine are given orally along with some creams like luliconazole or sertaconazole, etc. Itching can be controlled with antiallergics.

Welcome to icliniq & thanks for the query. Recurrent boils can be a nuisance. It is a bacterial infection of the hair follicle and can cause painful pus filled eruptions on the body. If you are having frequent recurrences it could be because of persistent infection or reinfection. Are you diabetic or atopic? If so, you may be more prone to develop recurrent bacterial infections. You mention seeing pus coming from many openings which indicates it could be a carbuncle. This may need incision & drainage. Ideally a pus culture should be done to know the sensitivity of the organism and antibiotics started accordingly to completely treat the infection. Usually penicillins, cephalosporins or tetracyclines are used orally. Application of mupirocin in the skin fold areas helps to eradicate the colonising bacteria in these locations. Some precautions to prevent recurrent boils include: Hope this helps  ', 'Patient': 'I have had boils appear from time to time. The come to a head , break and drain.

Without knowing my pregnancy, I took hot sauna during my 4th week. Should I be worried?', 'Doctor': \"Hello. Neural tube defects (NTD) in the baby mostly occur in women deficient in Folic acid, or who are diabetic, or if they have any family history or as an associated defect with other chromosomal anomalies. Yes, the baby's organs do develop in the early weeks of pregnancy, and any extreme exposures can pose risk for maternal health and also for fetal development. But I have never come across the risk of developing NTD with exposure to sauna. But anyway it would be better if you avoid it for the future. As of now you need not worry too much about this exposure, stay calm and stay positive. The first-trimester scanning at 12 weeks is good enough to pick any NTDs and I do not think that would be too late, or you need to go for any termination of pregnancy just because of the exposure to sauna. At this early pregnancy, there is no means to find out if the baby has developed any abnormalities or not. And also the second TM scan detailed anatomical scan at 18-20 weeks can also pick most (90-95%) of any structural anomalies. Also regarding your gestational age calculations, if your cycles were always regular, then you should calculate the weeks from the starting day of your last menstrual period. It would have been really helpful if you had mentioned the same, it would have helped me correlate if your assumption of weeks of pregnancy are correct or not. I am assuming, as you said you are in the fifth week now, so you just skipped your periods a few days back. Tablet Folic Acid 5 mg daily once after food.

The whole point of the sauna is to detox, and I definitely was overheating (sweating and red-faced). I did however take two breaks where I jumped in cold water to cool down. Anyways, I read that overheating when pregnant can cause horrible neural tube damage that can lead to birth defects especially in these crucial early weeks when it is forming. My question is how worried should I be? Should I go to a specialist for this? Is it so bad that I should consider termination?

Is it due to blockage of blood vessel?', 'Doctor': 'Hello. Her foot appears to be in good condition now (attachment removed to protect patient identity). The likely cause for bluish discoloration is blockages only and is called peripheral arterial disease. So of she should be treated on the line of blockages itself. Now blockages in the foot raise the strong possibility of blockages elsewhere in the body like heart, brain, and its fortunate that she did not suffer any consequences due to that. So she should be evaluated with few investigations, like ECG (echocardiogram), Echo, Fasting lipid profile (sugar if not done recently). Also, to confirm the diagnosis, she should undergo CT (computed tomography) angiography of both the lower limbs. Now coming to the treatment part, obviously, the best would be to open it with stents. But as of now, she will need some more medications than what she is having. You may continue with Neurowin or better to have it in a tablet form once daily, and it is just a multivitamin supplement. She should also continue plain Ecospirin and dose should be 75 mg only at bedtime. Now in my opinion, she should additionally have tablet Rosuvastatin 10 mg bedtime once daily and tablet Cilostazol 50 mg twice daily after food. She should also have some antacids along with these medications like tablet Cyra 20 mg (Rabeprazole) once daily before breakfast. So these three medications should be added additionally until her evaluation is completed and probably will need to continue for the long term. Zerodol SP should be avoided as it may harm her by causing bleeding or raising blood pressure. Plain paracetamol is allowed. She should be encouraged to move and walk atleast 30 minutes a day as it would improve blood flow. I hope this helps.  ', 'Patient': 'Hello doctor, Patient is an 82-year-old female.

Practically speaking if the vaginal dryness causing significant impairment in your quality of life, it is time to see a doctor.

At first let me ensure you that taking an extra dose of Levothyroxine by accident is unlikely to harm you. You get side effects such as rapid heart beat, chest pain, sweating, nervousness, etc. They may not develop at once, it may be several days before they come on. These side effects that are resulted from over dose will be subside over time and basically no treatment is needed. Normal range for TSH level is 0.4-4 mU/L.so your recent TSH level is within normal limit. As your last year TSH level was 0.55 mU/L and recent result is 2.6 mU/L which is within the normal limit, so continue your current dose of Levothyroxine. No dose adjustment is needed. Now you are suffering from weight gain, puffy eyes, hair loss, etc., if these are resulted from the side effects of Levothyroxine then they will be subsided soon.

I see you have taken all the necessary medications for the fissure in anus. What I would like to tell you is you need to do two more important things. Firstly, since you have fissure and piles I can guess you might have constipation quite commonly hence you must be straining to pass the stools so I suggest you stop straining while passing stools. Next, add fiber to your diet. Consuming one cucumber and carrot a day will help you a lot to avoid constipation. Also, drink plenty of water throughout the day. Secondly, how you use the medication is also important. I advise you to do a sitz bath twice a day (add Betadine 5 ml in lukewarm water in a tub and sit on it for 5 to 10 minutes). Next apply the Lox-2% (Lignocaine hydrochloride) cream (opaque) and not gel, as gel does not get absorbed and the cream crosses the skin. Apply it before passing stools and immediately after cleaning yourself after passing the stools. You can apply it whenever you have severe pain also. You can also take syrup Lactulose 15 ml at night time after food for 10 days. For the piles, if you have third or fourth-degree piles then surgery is the only choice. For first and second degrees you can treat by tablet Daflon 500 mg one tablet a day for 14 days. Apply Pilex ointment or Hemoproct ointment before sleep in the anal region. Avoid anal sex if any until the fissure heals. Lastly, all acute fissure can be treated by the methods I have mentioned here and more than any medication follow the dietary advice and you can keep the fissure occurrence under control. However, if the fissure is persistent for more than two to three months it is better to get operated. Suggested operations are lateral internal sphincterotomy for the fissure and hemorrhoidectomy for piles. Also, keep a check on your viral load and Cd4 counts. I hope this helps.

The different masses can be inflammation of epididymis which is above the testis or spermatocele which is a cyst containing sperms and it can be painful if infected. Abscess also can be near the testis and can cause pain. Hematoma blood collection beside testis results from trauma or injury. Other thing like torsion of testis means twist of testis and blockage of its blood supply is considered an emergency and needs an immediate operation.

The most common reason for nose bleeds in children of this age group is 1. Frequent nose picking: We need to ascertain the cause of the nasal bleeds as the most common cause is secondary to dry nose and crusting which in turn causes irritation. Dry nose can be treated by using saline nasal drops four drops six times a day to ensure that the child's nasal mucosa is kept moist and does not dry up. In addition, I would also recommend the child not to get directly exposed to AC / fan as it can also dry up the nasal mucosa often. 2. Adenoid hypertrophy: Usually the adenoids increase in size and they can also be a reason for recurrent nasal bleeds. The child can be put on Mometasone nasal spray two puffs two times a day for the next coming three weeks. 3. Infection in the nose: This can also be another cause of recurrent crusting and inflammation in the nose which results in nasal bleeds. You can give her syrup Augmentin (Amoxicillin and Clavulanic acid) 228.5 mg 4ml three times a day after food for the next one week. It is better to treat all three possibilities for long term relief from the symptoms. All three aspects are extremely common and there is nothing that you need to worry about as it is very common for children to present with such a problem.

Can high WBC be the cause?', 'Doctor': 'Hi. Whenever we suffer an infection, our body’s immune mechanism comes into action. Those immune cells are nothing but WBCs (white blood corpuscles). So if the WBCs are high, then either there is an infection or the body is trying to fight bad cells in the body. WBCs are not the cause of infection. But it can cause fever by its actions. So whenever someone has a fever, it is very likely that they also have a high WBC count. There are different types of WBCs which increase/decrease in different situations. So the aim of doing blood tests is to see if only one type of WBCs are involved or there are multiple increased cell lines. Our diagnosis depends heavily on which type of WBCs are increased. So please put up the baby’s blood sample reports.  ', 'Patient': 'Hello doctor, My baby is 2 years old. She is having a high fever for two days now.

Please advise.'}, {'id': 355, 'Description': 'Q. Is it normal to get sharp shooting chest pain with increased heart rate in a patient with AR?', 'Doctor': 'Hello. Firstly it is a moderate to severe AR (aortic regurgitation) with normal heart function and normal LV dimension. So there is no significant damage to the heart. And also since you do not have symptoms of aortic regurgitation like palpitations or shortness of breath with exertion, serial monitoring with echo would be enough. Now regarding chest pain, it is unlikely to be cardiac. It is likely related to acid reflux which is diluted by drinking water. So you may have some antacid medications like Rabeprazole, Domperidone or Pantoprazole and Domperidone combination before breakfast for few days. You should also avoid spicy, oily, and hot foods as much as possible. Have light meals and walk for sometime after meals rather than resting immediately. Avoid too much tea or avoid caffeinated drinks. Now regarding heart rate, it is unusual for heart rate to go up this much with simple walking, however, with running it is expected. Also, one would certainly feel palpitations at this high heart rate. And arrhythmic tachycardia would have other associated symptoms like dizziness, shortness of breath, chest pain, etc. So it is probably an artefact, which is read as heartbeat by watch. It is better if you can wear a watch which also shows ECG tracings to confirm it or have 24-hour Holter monitoring to confirm it. Amtas is for blood pressure, not to control heartbeat so if your blood pressure is elevated then you may have it. So in a nutshell, it is probably artefactual rather true tachycardia, as it is unlikely for the heart rate to go above 150 with just walking. However, if one is too breathless during walking or has severe low hemoglobin or hyperthyroidism with baseline elevated heart rate of more than 100 bpm then it may or otherwise not. I hope this helps.  ', 'Patient': 'Hi doctor, My history: I am a patient of aortic regurgitation (moderate-severe) with a bicuspid valve. SB III (as per my last checkup). My question is, many times I feel a sudden sharp shooting pain in the middle and slight left of the chest which shortens the breath and gets normal within a few seconds (drinking water helps in to be able to breathe at this time). Also, I wear a MI fit to track the heart rate while walking. Even when not walking too fast, my heart rate touches 165 bpm. Is this normal? I am suggested to take Amtas 2.5 but I have not too it so far. Please help.'}, {'id': 356, 'Description': 'Q. What can be done to treat stomach pain, gas, bloating with indigestion?', 'Doctor': 'Hello. I can imagine the level of your frustration for your chronic unresolving symptoms. And I really feel sorry to hear that you been back and forth around doctors for solution of your symptoms. Well, I can very well understand your problem, I will explain to you point by point.  1. Lax LES (lower esophageal sphincter) is not a uncommon findings on endoscopy. It reflects that the valve which controls reflux from stomach to lower part of food pipe is little bit open. However, your endoscopy did not show any ulcer formation in the food pipe which suggest you do not have Gastroesophageal reflux (GERD). Again your symptoms are not related to GERD. It is something else. I tell in a moment.  2. So you see the fundal gastritis (inflammation of the fundus- a part of stomach). Usually inflammation of stomach confines to the other parts of stomach -like antrum and stomach body, but not to the fundus. The one cause of inflammation predominantly to the fundus suggest H pylori infection. This bug initially infect antrum of the stomach then it moves to fundus if chronic infection that has not been treated. I will suggest you investigation before I suggest you an antibiotic course of this H pylori. And remember this H pylori can cause stomach slowing leading to your symptoms of gas. The condition is called gastroparesis. Below I explain to you in more detail the reasons of your symptoms of gas.  3. To simplify the constellation of your symptoms, we doctors classify in to two- the predominant gaseous symptoms or predominantly pain symptoms. You have predominantly gaseous symptoms including bloating, sounds, burping, fullness, early satiety after meals, and some gas in stools as well.  So it is important you should understand why these gases production is in excess in you. The one such reason is: i) Dysbiosis-which is alteration of human gut bacteria more gas producing species. These bacteria or harmlessly present in the human gut, however; at times the environmental factors, food, water, other dietary habits; change the composition of these bacteria and turn them in to gas producing bacteria. I will give you an antibiotic for a 3 week duration, this will correct your dysbiosis. ii) The other reason is excessive of food intake that produces gases. These foods are collectively called as FODMAPs. These foods to be avoided as possible as you can. I will share with you a link where you will find the list of such foods which should be avoided. iii) Less common mechanism is feeling of normal amount of gases-this condition is called hypersensitive gut. For this I would suggest you behavioral therapy called diaphragmatic breathing. I will share you the link how you can exercise it at your home.  I really hope now you would the some idea of mechanism causing your chronic unresolving symptoms. I would just correct your above mentioned mechanism, and you would see the things get improved for you. Please find below treatment plan, and I want you should update me about your symptoms in coming 2 weeks time. Secondly, I also want to suggest you some investigations as we can exclude any other possibility and treat the things accordingly. Dysbiosis  Functional bloating and gas  H pylori infection  Overweight Complete blood count  TSH, FT3, FT4 Liver function tests Anti TTg IgA and IgG fasting sugar level fasting lipid profile  Stool for H pylori antigen  Stool for Giardiasis antigen  Stool for Fecal calprotectin stool for ova and parasites  Stool for Fat globules and reducing substance Capsule Rifaximin 200 mg thrice daily for 3 weeks. This is for dysbiosis  Avoid FODMAPs Diet.  Diaphragmatic breathing. Tab Digestine (Metoclopramide) 40 mg half hour before meals. You can stop the Motilitum.  You can continue with Pantodac. You should stop PEG 4k.  You can continue with Librax but increase the dose to one tablet twice daily after meals. Avoid FODMAPs. I really hope that your symptoms will improve in coming 2 weeks times, till then you get some tests and revert back to me. In the end of treatment course, I would consider giving you another class of medication that you take for life long.

My daughter has pinhole on nasal bridge with swelling and discharge at present. Please help.', 'Doctor': 'Hi. This is definitely a dermoid cyst sinus. This lesion typically presents as a small opening (sinus) at birth and as the child grows the wall lining in the cyst accumulates sebaceous material which can get secondarily infected, resulting in swelling and then a discharge. In very few cases, the sinus disappears as age progresses. The infection has to be treated with antibiotics and once the infection subsides this cyst along with the enter sinus tract has to be excised under general anesthesia. For now, you can give her an antibiotic containing Amoxicillin with Potassium clavulanate 475 mg 4 ml three times a day for one week. In addition syrup Ibugesic plus (or its equivalent) 4 ml two times a day for one week to reduce the inflammation and pain. I think, for now, this should be sufficient.

Why do I get this?', 'Doctor': \"Hello,  Welcome to icliniq.com. Well, I understand you have pain with diarrhea and pain that lasts a few hours before it goes away. Listening to your history, it seems a few possibilities. The pain of intestinal loops affecting the cecum a part of large bowel or terminal ileum which is small bowel. The causes are many but given your age, there are possibilities of Crohn's, yersinia infection or Whipple, and lastly uncommon is intestinal tuberculosis. The other possibility is renal stones. It is not necessary to have stones in urine in person with renal stones. Thirdly, functional abdominal pain syndrome which is basically hypersensitivity of the intestine to food, stools, water, etc. This pain cannot cause weight loss however, the causes mentioned above can cause fever and weight loss.  The third often overlooked cause of pain is nerve entrapment pain. This is because of the compression of the nerve in between the muscles. You see the list of differentials can be shrunken after a good history. I want you to tell me more about your symptoms in context to the above-mentioned conditions as we then target the one or two and investigate specifically and then can suggest treatment for the underlying cause.

Since these are the normal.process of body of emitting gases which are produced in the small bowel. However, excessive gases are produced in someone who have problem with two things. 1. carbohydrate maldigestion. The corbohydtates are the major compotent of our diet approx. 70% of diet we take it is corbohydrates. This corbohydrates are fermented by small bowel.bacteria and produces excessive gases..one such example is milk and wheat grains and barley rye etc. You have to cut them to half before excessive production of gases can be prevented. At least you should try avoiding milk and milk based dairy production such as coffee, tea, icecream, and sweets. You can learn more about the foods who are carbohydrated and who freqeuntly cause excessive gas production on the internet. 2. Dysbiosis. Excessive of gas producing bacteria and lack of lactobacillus which help digest corbohydrats. This altered composition of bacteria is due to many factors namely oast use of antibiotic use, enviormental influence, sorts of diet one take and water one take. The one way is to treat this dysbiosis with a 10 day antibiotic course -Tab Rifaximin 500 mg twice daily for 10 days. Followed by use of probiotic which are healthy bacteria reguraly for 6 months at least. With the above explanation and advise you would be in good position to treat your condition..

Is colposcopy used to diagnose HPV?', 'Doctor': \"Hello, Welcome to Icliniq. There is a difference between all the tests you underwent. To make it clear for you I will explain one at a time. 1) Pap smear - it's a test used to screen if a women can be harbouring cancerous or precancerous cells over the mouth of the uterus ( i.e. CERVIX) , so basically a screening test for cervical cancer and it's pre cancerous changes. And as it is just a screening tests, it can not always diagnose if you have any foci of cancer over the cervix. it just give characteristics of the cells which were studied on the smears. So unless they are overtly cancerous looking, we always try to rule that out by doing other tests, So next comes the HPV ( Human Papilloma Virus) testing. 2) HPV testing - It's a test to detect the causative agent of the cervical cancer, that is human Papilloma Virus, it's spread through sexual contact. Based on their genomic sequence, they can be categorised into various types. So warts are caused by the low risk type that is 6 & 11. where as there some 12 high risk types which can cause cervical cancer, so these are detected in the HPV testing ( Depending on your test done - as various tests have different sensitivity & specificity). Of these high risk majority are caused by Type 16 & 18. So once a women starts her sexual activity, almost 70- 80% women may have HPV infection but it gets cleared over 1-2years, so that is why we do not test it for women less than 30yrs ( I see you haven't mentioned your age).So as the HPV is a virus and it coming positive indicates higher risk of having precancerous changes or may be risk of cervical cancer in future, we need to see if any changes have already happened to substantiate the previous tests. So then comes the role of colposcopy. 3) Colposcopy - it's basically a test to visualise the cervix under huge magnification and to see for any deviation from normal, and to look for any changes over the cervix which can hint on being abnormal or precancerous, so that from that particular abnormal sites biopsies canbe taken and subjected to histopathological examination ( where a pathologist sees the tissue under microscope to look for any cancerous cell). So as your colposcopy finding are normal, your gynaec may call you repeat testing after 6-12months for repeat cytology & HPV testing. If the Repeat screening are negative twice then you can just follow the screening protocols routinely as other women. Please share the reports of your HPV & Pap smear so that I can go through & guide you through in case you any further doubts.  Hope the information helps you.

Please interpret his CT scan.', 'Doctor': 'Hello. I have gone through the CT report (attachment removed to protect patient identity). There are variations in the branching pattern, but this is fine to have. Many individuals have such a branching pattern without any consequences. Slight bulging was mentioned at ramification, but they also commented that it appears to be within normal limits. And such slight bulging would not cause pain or would not have any consequences unless there is any obstruction within it. Important is that there is no obstruction or abnormal course of left coronary artery. They have mentioned that the left coronary has a slightly high take off which is fine and unlikely to be responsible for symptoms or complications. So, as far as coronaries are concerned, they are unlikely to be responsible for his symptoms and unlikely to end up in any adverse consequences. Now I guess, he must have had an ECG and echo, which would give additional assurance to this. Now if according to symptoms, they are again not classical of heart. If they were cardiac then they would have certainly aggravated by activities. So unlikely to be a cardiac issue. Now considering his reflux issue, the first possibility should be considered of acid reflux and secondly of musculoskeletal even if there is no definitive demonstrable tenderness. Omeprazole may not be able to counteract reflux totally. So it is worthwhile to try locally acting agents like syrup Sucralfate and see if it helps. Light meals and some walking after meals. Locally acting agent Diclofenac gel may also be tried. I hope this helps.  ', 'Patient': 'Hello doctor, My 8-year-old son has been having chest pains since six months.

What is the chance of pregnancy?', 'Doctor': 'Hello. Firstly, as you had three episodes of menstrual bleed including the withdrawal bleed post-emergency contraceptive after you had intercourse in March, so it is unlikely that you would be pregnant due to your sexual encounter in March. As you have missed your menses now by four days and if you have been sexually active during this cycle as well, then you must rule out pregnancy first with a home urine pregnancy test kit. If negative, then the delay is most likely stress-induced and you should wait for at least five days to allow menses to start naturally. If not, then you would need an ultrasound pelvis to check for endometrial thickness which if more than 8 mm. You can be offered a withdrawal bleed with progesterones to resume your menses.

For an allergic reaction to develop, initial exposure must occur in order for your body to create an immune response to it. This might have happened a few months ago when you were stung before. Since there was already an exposure and established immune response, subsequent exposure may result in allergic reaction. Severe allergic reaction resulting in anaphylaxis may occur but most of the time allergic reaction is mild and not life threatening. Symptoms such as excessive skin reactions, including hives and itching and flushed or pale skin, low blood pressure, constriction of your airways and a swollen tongue or throat, difficulty breathing, weak and rapid pulse, nausea, vomiting or diarrhea and dizziness or fainting warrants immediate consult.

I had three anxiety attacks last night because of ringing sound in my ears. Please help.', 'Doctor': 'Hello First of all, please know that ringing sensation is very common and prevalent. There are many suspected causes for ringing sensation in the ear. The most common ones being - wax impinging on the ear-drum, sudden, loud noise, moving into a quiet room from a noisy environment and so on. You say it started after a bath. Even water, soap, hair follicles within your ear, when come in contact with the ear-drum can cause such ringing sensation, although for a short duration. This might have even attracted your attention to a symptom which might have been there even before, but was not noticeable. Sometimes, the medications you are on also can cause this ringing sensation. To be honest, there are lots of causes but no sure way of evaluating it. So, my suggestion - try diverting your thoughts away from this and try concentrating on some other work. When your thoughts are deeply immersed in something else, you will realise that you can hear the ringing sensation only if you think about it. You can also listen to music with ear-phones, with the volume of your device between 30-60% to get your mind off it. But please don’t do this all day. Give a gap of atleast an hour after listening for about 30 minutes. Also, it will probably not bother you when you are involved in a conversation with somebody, keeping your mind off it. All said, there are certain rare causes also, which require systematic treatment, but I wouldn’t want you to worry about them right away. This symptom of yours has started all of a sudden and in all probability might disappear spontaneously as well.

Few days after breakage of condoms, I have sticky penis and inflammation of foreskin. Why?', 'Doctor': 'Hi. I understand your worry about the swelling of the foreskin you covered with antibiotics with a single dose of Azithromycin and later with one week of Amoxicillin. If there is sexually transmitted disease it might come back for mainly two reasons. Firstly, incomplete treatment and insensitive antibiotics as you did not have a culture result, and secondly, not treating the sexual partner. Therefore, after completing the Amoxicillin no need for more antibiotics hopefully the foreskin swelling resolves. You will need STD (sexually transmitted disease) screening for you and your partner needs a vaginal swab. If you got pain like burning sensation while passing urine or swelling or urethral discharge then you will need to do urethral swab culture as well. The swelling of the foreskin and sticky discharge might have been caused by sexually transmitted disease as the condom was torn we do not have culture results as you started antibiotics before a culture of your urethra was sent. It is great that with Amoxicillin you are getting better. My suggestion is to complete the Amoxicillin course. Then to do the sexually transmitted diseases tests (STD screening) which is chlamydia testing by swab taken from urethra, gonorrhea testing, syphilis tests, trichomonas tests, human papillomavirus (HPV), herpes test, hepatitis B surface antigen test, hepatitis C test, HIV antibody and HIV antigen blood test for you and your partner. Those investigations will help diagnose and prevent future recurrence. No need for any more medications for now apart from the Amoxicillin you are currently on I would be pleased to follow you after tests result to inform for further treatment if required. Urethral swab for partner and STD screen for both and urethral swab of the patient in case symptomatic. STD (sexually transmitted disease).

Two weeks later, I developed symptoms of pain and slight swelling in my right testicle, lower abdominal pain, and foreskin inflammation.

Further, my foreskin and penile glans have now become sticky to touch, like a stick note, although it is not moist. I had also developed rashes on my inner thigh. I consulted a doctor who prescribed me T Bact for my sticky and slightly swollen foreskin, Betnovate N for my rashes in my inner thighs, and put me on a seven-day course of Amoxicillin 500 mg for three days. I am on day 5 of this course and my symptoms seem to have eased up significantly, but I fear a relapse could occur like last time. I have minimal abdominal pain now, and my testicles only feel a little uncomfortable from time to time.

I am unable to conceive with normal cycle. Please prescribe fertility medication.', 'Doctor': 'Hello. Fertility medications cannot be prescribed without a thorough evaluation. This involves finding the exact cause of not being able to conceive whether it is female factors or the male factor. Among the female factor, ovulatory dysfunction is the most common cause. Also, tubal factors like tubal block can also cause difficulty in conceiving and thus need evaluation. I see that your previous cycles have been regular but this time you had a delayed cycle which is the first time you observed this. Delayed cycles indicate ovulatory dysfunction, which could be due to hormonal disturbance of thyroid or Prolactin Hormone, or due to a lifestyle condition like PCOS (polycystic ovary syndrome). Also, I see you are overweight for your height. I would like to know many more details about your issues, like if you have any acne issues or any unwanted facial hair growth. Was there any recent weight gain? What is the average coital frequency in a week? Do you have any vaginal discharge and frequent lower abdominal pain? Have you had tuberculosis or any other chronic medical conditions in the past? Have your husband got a semen analysis done, what is his age, and what does he do? As it is the third day of your periods today, you can get the below mentioned medical tests done and consult a fertility expert with reports for further evaluation and management. Treatment would depend on the underlying causes. In 10-20% of cases, there may not be any attributable causes. It is called unexplained infertility. In such cases, also your fertility expert may suggest assisted reproductive techniques to increase the chances of pregnancy. I hope this helps. Hemogram. Lipid profile.

I have sinusitis with polyp in right maxillary sinus. Please help.', 'Doctor': 'Hi. We have to first ascertain as to why sinusitis has occurred in the first place. Usually, in most cases, the primary cause is a seasonal or year around allergic problem that is there. Just to make you understand I have tried to explain things in a simple way below. Exposure to dust (or any irritative substance that your body is hypersensitive to) will initially initiate reflexes such as sneezing to remove the offending agent out but if this fails, mucosal cells in you nose start to hyperfunction producing loads of mucus to trap dust (owing to its sticky nature), this mucus has no where to go other than either being blown out of due to mucociliary activity gets pushed into the throat, thereby entering into a new zone. The throat initially reacts by activating cough impulses to push out the mucus, but if that fails, a local inflammation around the throat starts which often leads to symptoms such as feeling of a lump in the throat and repeated feeling to clear the throat. As far as your nose is concerned, due to long standing inflammation, the mucosa starts to get edematous and ends up forming a polyp. I know the problem is there since a long five years, but I am not sure if you have followed any specific treatment chart which is usually recommended before we consider any patient for surgery. This treatment chart is custom made according to your symptoms and does follow the guidelines to treat both allergy with sinusitis. The following things can be considered. 1. Wear an n95 mask at all times, do not allow any dust or irritative substance from entering into your nose. This is the most important thing you should be following failing which, no treatment will bring any relief. 2. Tablet Sinarest (Paracetamol + Phenylephrine hydrochloride + Chlorpheniramine maleate) one tablet twice daily after food 12 hours apart for 15 days. 3. Tablet Allegra M (Fexofenadine and Montelukast) one tablet twice daily after food 12 hours apart for 15 days. 4. Tablet Zerodol TH (Aceclofenac and Thiocolchicoside) 4mg (or its equivalent) one tablet twice daily after food for five days. 5. Tablet Clarithromycin 500 mg one tablet twice daily after food. 6. Duonase nasal spray (or its equivalent) two puffs two times a day in both nostrils for three months (do not inhale while you spray the drug). 7. Tablet Mucomix 600 mg (Acetylcysteine) one tablet twice daily for 1 week. 8. Tablet Wysolone (Prednisolone) 10 mg one tablet after breakfast for 10 days. 9. Steam inhalations 3 to 4 times a day. 10. Saltwater gargles at 8 to 10 times a day for one month. 11. Do not smoke or consume alcohol as it slows down mucociliary clearance mechanisms. All precautionary measures have to be followed strictly for maximum relief, otherwise, medications would not be useful on the long term. Surgery can be considered (if above medications and precautionary measures do not give any relief), but there is a catch to it. The symptoms might come back sometimes even on a higher scale after a brief relief following surgery if the precautionary measures post surgery are not followed. Ideally speaking in a nutshell, I again emphasis on preventing any irritative substance from entering the nose and throat, thereby triggering an allergic cascade of events and reproducing the symptoms you have mentioned above. As far as the polyp is concerned, in very few cases the polyp resolves on its own with medications and often the patient requires a surgery called functional endoscopic sinus surgery where the sinus openings are widened and the polyps are removed. You will have to get a CT scan done to see the extent of the polyp, current condition of the other sinuses and anatomical variations in the nose which could have been contributing to the polyp. I hope this helps.  ', 'Patient': 'Hi doctor, I am a 31-year-old male. I have sinusitis for almost five years. Also, there is polyp formation in the right maxillary sinus.

Well, your US (ultrasound) and CT (computed tomography) scan are normal which is kind of satisfying to me. Of course you suppose to have more blood tests to confirm the origin of this jaundice.

The causes of predominantly raised bilirubin (jaundice) with normal CT scan suggest microscopic primary sclerosing cholangitis, primary biliary cholangitis benign and progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis.

I need to know whether the loose stools are really having organic cause or just secondary to functional changes occuring with time of periods. Loose stools are said when stool volume is more than 200 ml in a day, semisolid to liquid in consistency.

But accompany with emotional and physiologic changes in to abdomen, skin, body blood circulation. You just make sure, that you take home made well cooked diet.

I could have helped you much if you have provided some more information about that pain and quantity of stools. Well, onset for 24 hours, mild cramping, does not show any alarming symptoms.

The pain of twisting of veins is an strange term in itself. Why would veins twist around in a healthy young lady with no previous significant medical history. So I do not believe this. Second, the gall bladder is not removed in asymptomatic gall stones. Asymptomatic gall stones are those which do not cause symptoms, and the symptoms of gall stones occur usually when the stone size is 10 mm, if smaller than this, it is unlikely that your pain was gall stone related. Since you did not mention size of gall stones, otherwise it would have been easy to tell you whether it was cause of your pain or not. Other, the pain of gall stones has to be typical in nature; the pain which occur in right upper quadrant of the abdomen (at site of your liver), pain starts suddenly mostly after half hour of meals, peaks within 1 hours, and then starts settling in next 4 to 6 hours. Vomiting and nausea can frequently accompany with this pain. If you have that typical type of pain, then it may be from gall bladder. Your third question. The answer is no. No drug therapy can prevent from formation of stones or dissolution of stone. There are some therapies which are used as in experience, but they are not recommended at all. If gall bladders stones are symptomatic then they has to be removed by doing gall bladder resection via laparoscopy. If not symptomatic, then no need of any drug or surgical therapy. Having said that, elective gall bladder resection is indicated among patients who could not bear the risk of cholecystitis, such as pregnant ladies with size of stones more than 10 mm, or patients with smaller gallbladder stones but having pancreatitis. Stone but without symptoms and presence of gall bladder polyps. These three types of patients can have surgery despite no symptoms.

The doctor asked for an ultrasound and in ultrasound the stone was in its place. No inflammation or fluid accumulation. Gall bladder size was normal. The doctor said that the pain was due to twist of certain veins and is not due to gallstone. I want to ask that whether twisting of vein can cause pain? Is it necessary to do operation?

I can understand your concern about symptoms complex and ultrasound findings and whether surgery is the answer to your problem. Well, first of all, I want to clear that you do not have stones in the gallbladder. They are concretions. It is a medical term and they are called microlithiasis (gall bladder stones less than 3 mm in size). So the possibility of developing cholecystitis (gall bladder inflammation) is very low. However, this microlithiasis can cause pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas which is a gland sitting over the back of the abdomen). Thirdly, the pain can be secondary to the functional gall bladder problem, where the gall bladder is naturally slow resulting in damping of bile (yellow secretion produced by the liver and stored within gallbladder) and production of small concretions such as in y our case. So I would ask you to get a few blood tests to confirm whether you have pain due to pancreatitis. I also want that you should discuss to me in more detail about your pain, as only proper history can give me a clue towards your problem whether gall bladder inflammation, pancreatitis, or functional gall bladder disorder even before any further testing. Since the ultrasound findings and your symptoms are not correlated very well, there is no point in discussing the role of surgery. But I just want to assure you that you probably need no surgery, so do not worry about it. I suggest you some tests, please get it done, then I would recommend you some lifestyle changes and a medical treatment that can help you resolve your minor stones within the gallbladder. I hope this helps. Pancreatitis. Cholecystitis. Peptic ulcer disease. Functional gallbladder disorder (gallbladder dyskinesia). Complete blood count. Serum amylase and lipase. Liver function tests.

After eight weeks, you should have it once a month for the next six months. Now the liver enzyme is deranged likely due to fatty liver, which is related to deranged lipid profile. You should get an ultrasound of liver to confirm it. Now since LDL (low density lipoprotein) is moderately elevated, you may give a try of a healthy lifestyle. So you should have a healthy lifestyle like avoiding fatty, oily, high calorie foods. Avoid fried, fast food, egg yellow, non veg consumption, and avoid excessive oil. Do not reuse the cooking oil once used for frying. Have regular exercises like brisk walking or running according to the capacity for atleast 30 minutes a day.

What could have caused all these?', 'Doctor': 'Hi. I can understand your concern. According to your statement, you have been suffering from back pain, tiredness, more sleepy feeling, and inflammation on foot. I have gone through your investigations (attachment removed to protect patient identity) result and found that your Vitamin D3 level is below normal, GGT (gamma-glutamyl transferase) level slightly high, HDL (high dentisy lipoprotein) level below normal, TG (thyroglobulin) and VLDL (very density lipoprotein) level significantly high, TSH (thyroid-stimulating hormone) level normal at the upper limit. Total leucocyte count with lymphocytes count slightly high, eosinophil count are significantly high. So your back pain, tiredness, more sleepy feeling with inflammation of foot may result from vitamin D3 deficiency. Clinical features of vitamin D3 deficiency are repeated infections, tiredness, back pain, depression, bone pain, muscle pain, fatigue, delayed wound healing, feeling sleepy, etc. Again high TG levels may cause abdominal pain, loss of appetite, nausea or vomiting, tiredness, fatigue, etc. Your high eosinophil count indicates that you may suffer from allergies. As your TSH level is normal at a higher limit, so you should repeat the thyroid function test within three months. For your vitamin D3 deficiency, you should need more exposure to sunlight for vitamin D3 synthesis as well as take vitamin D3 enriched foods and supplements. For your high TG level, you should continue Fenofibrate along with Omega-3 fatty acid for low HDL level and repeat your lipid profile test after three months. For your low back pain, you can take Naproxen with Esmoprazole combination with Baclofen and calcium supplements.

I am just 21 years old but facing hair thinning problem. Will Finasteride help?', 'Doctor': 'Hi.  From the information given it seems you are experiencing the early signs of male pattern hair loss. This is a very common condition and there are many factors responsible, one of them being genetic. Due to the effect of the male hormone on the hair cycle, over a period of time the hair follicle starts shrinking and so the hair which comes out is thinner and more fragile and breaks easily. Also, the growing phase of the hair is shortened, so your hair does not grow as long it used to and becomes shorter and wispier. There are several treatment options available and the sooner we start the treatment the better the chances of reducing further hair loss/thinning and increasing regrowth. A combination of oral supplements to boost hair growth along with the application of lotions containing Minoxidil 5% to begin with will be the best course of action in my opinion. Oral Finasteride, which is the male hormone blocker, is used frequently. Applications with Finasteride are available too. This will be prescribed by your treating doctor after assessing the extent of thinning and discussing the side effects, etc. Several preparations of biopeptides and other natural ingredients like saw palmetto extract, melatonin, etc are also available to boost hair growth. PRP (platelet-rich plasma) is a popular procedure that is often used in combination with medical treatment to stimulate hair growth further. Usually, a combination of treatments is suggested after the clinical evaluation. But using the applications regularly is the key to good results. Hair regrowth takes a few months to show and you will have to be patient to see the benefit of treatment. I hope this helps.  ', 'Patient': 'Hello doctor, I am a 21-year-old male.

I have gone through your case several times and I think that all your sufferings may result from any infection due to any cause or allergies.Your skin rash may develop from any kind of allergies like food allergy, drug reaction or allergy, dust, or mite allergy. Then you developed an ear infection which may be due to bacterial cause. After that, you may suffer from conjunctivitis which is easy to catch through touching. You may get conjunctivitis by touching your infected hand that had touched your ear. In conjunctivitis, whitish-yellow discharge may come out under eyelid. You can use an antibacterial drop on your affected ear and eye with antihistamine along with or without broad-spectrum antibiotics orally.

According to your statement, you have been suffering from swelling of lymph nodes on the neck with swelling of tonsil and sore throat. You lead an erratic life. You are a smoker. You do not maintain your oral hygiene regularly. You also do not take your meal regularly. Your presenting clinical features can result from strep throat, peritonsillar abscess, tonsilloliths (tonsil stone), tonsillitis, Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma or carcinoma, etc. According to your picture that is provided here you may suffer from tonsil stone or peritonsillar abscess. In both cases, treatment are almost the same. You should take a broad-spectrum antibiotic for 7-10 days with gargle with salt mixed warm water, mouth wash, apple cider vinegar, and brush regularly. Usually tonsil stones dislodge themselves over time. If the clinical features such as difficulty in deglutition, difficulty in breathing, breathing difficulty during sleeping, pain radiating to ear, etc., occur consider as a medical emergency and consult with an ENT specialist for tonsillectomy. You should observe your lymph nodes carefully. Any sudden change in size or shape of lymph node, high fever, weight loss, night sweating, persistent fatigue, respiratory distress, etc., should be considered as alarming signs for carcinoma.

There are also flesh-colored bumps on the back of my mouth on the left side, they are not painful though. There is one on the top and one down by the tongue. I have not noticed these previously. My depression sometimes affects my hygiene, so I am hoping that this could be the cause of the stones. I have been brushing twice a day, flossing, gargling with salt water, and mouth wash. Since doing this, I have noticed much less swelling in my lymph nodes and a little less in my tonsils.

Please help.', 'Doctor': 'Hello. Your symptoms seem to be related to tension type headache, which is a benign headache. Light and sound intolerance are features of migraine, but the other symptoms you explain, are more compatible with tension type headache. Nevertheless, I agree with your doctor treatment regarding Escitalopram. You should know that the sleep disorders are related to different causes depression, daily stress and anxiety, vitamin D deficiency, an abnormal sleep regime, caffeine intake, etc. I would recommend taking Vitamin D if there is low plasma levels of this vitamin. Regarding your sleep disorder, I would recommend starting Zolpidem for a couple of weeks 10 mg before sleep. You can try half a tablet before going to 10 mg. Melatonine intake can regulate your sleep rhythms too, but it is taken for a more prolonged time than Zolpidem and its effects are lower. A good sleeping hygiene (sleep always at the same time, avoid straining physical or emotional activities before sleep, avoid caffeine intake) would help too. If all these tips and drugs are not helpful, a prolonged brain EEG (electroencephalogram) during sleep would help diagnose any possible sleeping disorders. Regarding Flunarizine, I would explain that this is a calcium channel blocker and as such it can interact with calcium or vitamin D in high amounts. But usually it does not affect the calcium levels. You can try taking Escitalopram for three months initially and then try Flunarizine, if no good results on Escitalopram. I would not recommend taking them both initially. You should know that Escitalopram achieves its effect after three weeks from the starting, and the main changes to be seen are a reduce in the frequency of headaches and also mood changes (optimism). You can try taking Amitriptyline too, if you do not have any symptoms relief after the first month on Escitalopram. It can be really helpful with the sleep too. All the drugs have some adverse effects, but the benefits are higher. I hope this helps.  ', 'Patient': 'Hello doctor, I have taken meningitis vaccination for visa process. I suffered headache with visual aura with dreamy sleep and less sleep for three months. I started treatment in India and took Cipralex, and Escitalopram. CT scan was normal.

I also suffered from scalp pain in head and treated for three months with Phenergan, and Neocalm plus. I felt only temporary relief. MRI was done in consultation with neurologist. Results are normal.

My symptoms are muscle tension and nerve pain. I did eyes test OCT and my eyes are normal. My questions are even if I am not stressed I do not get dreamless and refreshing sleep why?

The answer to your question entirely depends on how you developed the ear infection in the first place. In general, until the eardrum heals you will be having weird noises, tinnitus, and ear discomfort due to interference with sound transmission and processing. If the ear infection has happened secondary to recurrent allergy or cold, then you will have probably developed a eustachian tube catarrh due to which the fluid is still present in the middle ear causing the tinnitus and will take around two months approximately in toto for tinnitus to resolve. If the ear infection has occurred due to trauma (by earbuds etc), the tinnitus will take approximately four to six weeks, as this the average time it takes to heal the ear drum. I am sure you fall into one of the two possibilities mentioned above. There is absolutely nothing that you need to worry about as this usually takes a while for things to normalize. At the same time make sure there are no triggering factors out there. Some one they include use of earphones, headphones, exposure to loud sounds, consumption of alcohol, smoking, stress, etc. Try to maintain a healthy lifestyle as much as possible and do not think too much about the tinnitus nor try to Google about it too much.

It seems the rash and itching on the inner thighs could probably be due to a fungal infection of the skin. This is very common especially in tropical countries and more so in the hot humid summers. To accurately diagnose the same, further information like images of the affected area, total duration of the rash, any other areas affected, any discoloration of nails, etc., are needed. If it is indeed a fungal infection the following can be kept in mind. Treatment of fungal infections includes applications which contain Ketoconazole, Sertaconazole, Luliconazole, etc. Oral antifungals like Terbinafine and Itraconazole are often used in combination for better clearance and reducing recurrences. Local hygiene is very important. Taking bath daily, drying the skin folds after bath, keeping soap and towels separate and drying your clothes in sunlight and ironing them before wearing will help to kill the fungal spores.

As your cardiac workup is done and is normal, I do not think you need any more work up but if there are occasional symptoms associated with low pulse rate as graying of vision, dizziness, etc, I would advise you to have a Holter monitoring done for 24 to 48 hours to see rise and fall of heart rate during daily activities including sleep. If you have no symptoms, just relax and do not worry.

Other way if it really disturbs you during sexual intercourse then you can masturbate before intercourse. To remind you this precum can contain sperms so if you intend for pregnancy then you have to do protected intercourse. I hope this helps.  ', 'Patient': 'Hello doctor, I am a 35-year-old male.

I can very well understand your concern and at the start, I want to tell you that chronic straining does not lead to the development of hiatus hernia, however, your weight can. Hiatus hernia is an anatomical change that can present since birth, and after certain surgical procedures over abdomen or diaphragm, overweight to obese can develop hiatus hernia because of the excessive pressure over the stomach from belly fat, causing upward lifting of the lower part of food pipe and formation of hernia. And lastly, due to the old age when the diaphragmatic muscle gets weakened allowing part of the lower esophagus to get pulled in the lower part of the chest. In a young healthy people, diaphragmatic muscle is strong enough to prevent this from happening. Valsalva maneuver if performed vigorously can cause tears in the lower part of the esophagus which is an acute complication of this, but it will not alter the anatomy or produce a hiatus hernia. Valsalva can harm somebody if it is done without a reason (there are certain indications for medical conditions), but it can only cause damage to the lower part of the esophagus acutely but would not alter the anatomy of it i.e. hiatus hernia. Yes, an x-ray plain without contrast can easily miss a hiatus hernia. A special x-ray with contrast named barium is swallowed, and serial x-ray images from the chest are taken, that can diagnose the hiatus hernia instantly, however, a plain chest x-ray cannot detect the presence of hiatus hernia. So now coming to your second concern that you have to live with it. Well, it is not yet proven that you have a hiatus hernia, secondly, it is not uncommon to have hiatus hernia in people without any symptoms and it can remain undiagnosed until their whole life. The point is it can present harmlessly in human for years and years and does not necessitate any investigations. The time to develop a hiatus hernia is variable but it does take many years of overweight to cause hiatus hernia (very less likely within 6 to 12 months time). It is not a rule that every hiatus hernia would cause symptoms or disease or any complications. I would not suggest you even to worry about it and get tested for it. Because it would not change anything for you. Simple exercises, keeping a healthy lifestyle, reduce weight are all that is required. The weight loss is very compulsory, this will not only help you preventing hiatus hernia but also other things like gastroesophageal reflux (GERD), bloating, gas distention, constipation. I hope this helps. Overweight. Barium swallow if worried about it, or have symptoms suggestive of gastroesophageal reflux. Weight reduction. Follow up to discuss if any concern.  ', 'Patient': 'Hello doctor, I am a 31-year-old male who until recently weighed about 100 kg. For the last six months to a year, I was obsessively performing a Valsalva maneuver because I had health anxiety and OCD and I was worried about an operation. When I was younger I could have impacted my continence. I have been having some GI issues lately and read that you can cause a hiatal hernia from chronic straining. Is it possible that I could have caused a hiatal hernia at my age? Are six months to a year chronic enough? If I have caused a hiatal hernia will it stay forever? Or can I reduce it and the hernia size through exercise to tone and strengthen the diaphragm and weight loss? I am extremely worried I have caused a hernia and will have to live with it forever. I have had a standard x-ray of the chest which came back normal. Could a hernia have been missed?'}, {'id': 521, 'Description': 'Q. I have problem while initiating urine with erectile dysfunction.

Will CT scan help in determining the malignancy status of an enlarged lymph node?', 'Doctor': 'Hi. CT is a structural imaging method that relies on assessment of lymphnodes (LNs) based on their anatomy viz.size,shape, margins and enhancement patterns. Among these, size is still the most common criterion, a short axis diameter of more than 1 cm is generally accepted as a threshold for malignancy in most studies. However, the diagnostic sensitivity of this standard is weakened by the fact that many a times malignant LNs can be normal in size (false negative) and many infective nodes can be enlarged in size thus giving false positive results on imaging. Nowadays, CT is combined with PET (Positron emission tomography) to get both anatomical and functional information. It is called fusion imaging and is mainly used to diagnose and stage metastatic cancers such as lymphomas. CT also uses ionizing radiation (X-rays) that is another disadvantage which needs to be considered.  So to sum it all, structural imaging methods such as ultrasound, CT, conventional MRI do not distinguish benign LNs from malignant ones with 100 % accuracy. Conversely functional imaging methods such as DWI (diffusion weighted), PET have low spatial resolution and are time consuming. Therefore now we are seeing a shift towards fusion imaging techniques such as DWI-T2W1 MRI, PET/CT, etc., as these techniques bypass the above mentioned shortcomings.

Why did the doctor advise to stop breast milk and start Isomil formula for my baby?', 'Doctor': 'Hi, Am glad to hear you did not stop breast-feeding and that the baby’s weight gain is good. Babies of 3 months may pass stools after every feed-which means if you feed 10 times, they may pass stools 10 times. So that is not a thing to get worried. Regarding the colour of the stools, green-yellow-golden-brown are all normal shades of stools. So you don’t have to worry about green colour. Please remember one more important thing - if the baby is not having any problems/symptoms, then, don’t get any tests done. Because even in a completely normal person there can be a few parameters outside the normal range. We cannot keep chasing the lab report completely forgetting the baby’s condition. If you get a routine health check done during your visit to your pediatrician for vaccination it is sufficient (That is, if the baby is not having any problems/symptoms). Any change in the mother’s diet changes the composition of the breast milk to a small degree, which then is reflected on the child’s routine. You may start taking milk with tea, initially small amounts and gradually increase. The baby’s bowel movement pattern might change but that doesn’t mean it is not good for baby’s health. But don’t start to feed cow’s milk/pateurised milk to the baby yet. Let the baby be atleast 6-7 months for that. Please let me know if you have any questions.

What causes itchy skin rash around genitals?', 'Doctor': 'Hi. It seems the rash and itching in the groins and waist area could probably be due to a fungal infection of the skin. This is very common especially in tropical countries and more so in the hot humid summers. To accurately diagnose the same further information like images of the affected area, total duration of the rash, any other areas affected, any discoloration of nails, etc., is needed. If it is indeed a fungal infection the following can be kept in mind: 1. Treatment of fungal infections includes applications which contain Ketoconazole, Sertaconazole, Luliconazole, etc. Oral antifungals like Terbinafine and Itraconazole are often used in combination for better clearance and reducing recurrences. 2. Local hygiene is very important. Taking bath daily, drying the skin folds after bath, keeping soap and towels separate and drying your clothes in sunlight and ironing them before wearing will help to kill the fungal spores. So, I will recommend evaluation by a dermatologist to decide on the treatment. If you have any queries please feel free to reach out. Hope this helps.

I have not ovulated this month. Can it be due to Depot injection?', 'Doctor': 'Hello.  It is for your information that post prolonged use of Depot injection, the menstruation cycle is likely to be anovulatory for 2-3 cycles after it restarts post stoppage of injection. You had your initiation of bleed last month and had a proper menses 14 days later, but this cycle is likely to be anovulatory in most of the cases. So, even though you may be trying, yet you would not conceive. It would be best if you can start using ovulation kits from the next cycle from day 10 daily to check for LH surge, which would help find the time of ovulation (again whether or not you ovulate as well) and you would be able to have a better control over your actions.

Many a times the minimal bleeding or spotting could be either due to local genital infections or some ulcers or trauma. Sometimes even a piles problem or fissures bleeding may be confused as vaginal bleeding.

Causes in our case can be hormonal imbalance, insufficient protein intake, iron deficiency, hair procedures, rough handling, stress, and drug-related.

The surest test to detect a thyroid swelling is by doing an ultrasound to assess minor details, size, blood supply, and other aspects which we need to know before we treat you. Secondly, you need to get a thyroid function test wherein we assess the level of the thyroid hormones in your body. Thirdly, we also do a fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) to find out what was the cause of the swelling to occur in the thyroid. Here we insert a needle in your thyroid gland in areas of interest and then observe these cells under the microscope. For patients having thyroid problems (hypothyroid to be specific), we usually avoid foods belonging to the brassica family such as kale, rape, cabbage, cauliflower, and broccoli. These are known to block the synthesis of the thyroid hormones leading to its deficiency and thyroid enlargement. Seafood, bread, and milk are rich sources of iodine. Also, understand that a hyperfunctioning thyroid also can cause a thyroid swelling and the tests mentioned above are basic and have to be done to evaluate any patient with a thyroid problem. So in a nutshell, the doctor who deals with thyroid problems will definitely get these investigations to manage the problem further. I hope this helps.

Please help.', 'Doctor': 'Hi. It seems that the new skin range that you tried is not suiting your skin. It is important to know what all products you were using and the ingredients in these preparations. If it was a concentrate which had to be diluted and used then the redness and burning would be because of the irritant dermatitis. This could happen to anyone and the irritation of the skin is due to the very high concentration of ingredients in it. This kind of reaction will not happen if you dilute the preparation as advised by the manufacturer and use the product. Sometimes it can also be due to allergy to some components and this will recur every time you reuse the product. Once the skin is back to normal you can try testing the product by applying a small amount of the diluted product on the skin behind your ear or on the skin of the inner forearm. Observe the area for 24 hours. If you develop any itching, irritation, or redness it may indicate allergy to some ingredients. Further patch testing can then be advised to know the exact allergen.

You also mentioned it gets worse after eating, what food usually triggers it? Do you experience bloatedness or frequent flatulation? Does it get better when you burp or flatulate?

Judging by the information you gave and the attached O.C.T scan (attachment removed to protect patient identity) you have done: -The left eye seems quite normal. -The right eye has some macular edema. Meaning that there is fluid in the retina that is causing retinal stretching. Also, I can see neurosensory detachment in the retina too, this is probably due to long-standing diabetes. Retinal detachment usually manifests with seeing a bright light and floaters in the visual field as well as a drop of vision. (I will need to know if anything new happened to her vision). In this case, my opinion is: Your ophthalmologist will need to 1. Intravitreal injections of Avastin. This will help absorb the fluid leaking in the retina and causing the stretching. 2. If there is detachment he will need to reposition the retina with a vitrectomy procedure and retinal fixation and implanting temporary silicone. Do not worry this procedure can help maintain vision and maybe fix it for the better. It can be a little bit costly and you have to select an experienced vitreoretinal surgeon. 3.

Lump on my right side of anus healed on medication and now it has recurred on the left. What to do?', 'Doctor': \"Hello. It seems you have a perianal abscess. Perianal means around anus and abscess means collection of pus. It can be secondary to chronic itching and excoriation of the skin resulting in abscess formation. It can occur secondary to poor hygiene in and around the anal area. Since the one abscess is already burst, this will allow pus to drain and would heal itself. But the other evolving abscess would burst and lead to pain as you may be experiencing. There was the simple explanation of your problem, sometimes there is a problem with the small or large bowel, a condition is called Crohn's disease, which causes inflammation of the small, large bowel as well as perianal area resulting in an abscess, anal fissure, and fistula. I can recommend you some antibiotics but urge you to see a gastroenterologist in nearby and let be examined by him thoroughly. Or you can send me pictures of the area which is painful and discharging pus, as I can guide you further on this. For now take the following regimen for seven days, and come back to me to inform about improvement in your symptoms. We can then adjust medicine or add others if this does not work. Perianal abscess. Crohn's disease Stool for fecal calprotectin. Complete blood count. Crohn's disease. Perianal abscess.

The possibility of a sexually transmitted infection-induced lump is out as you are sexually inactive and masturbation carries no risk of sexually transmitted infections.

If he can ejaculate with masturbation but not with sex then it is a psychological issue. If he cannot ejaculate even with masturbation or in dreams then it is a physical issue for which some tests need to be done. Psychological issue is due to inhibition when a man cannot ejaculate in the presence of another person. It can be overcome by gradual desensitization. He can rub his penis on any body part of the female like buttocks, thighs, breasts, belly, etc, and try to ejaculate. The female can also masturbate him. It is a long drawn process and often frustrating but is useful. He can also self masturbate and on the verge of ejaculation put the head of penis into the vagina. Also vibrators can be used.

Do you have noticed any triggers (diets, stress, change in lifestyle, or drinking alcohol ) before such episodes? Alcohol has a large amount of fermentable carbohydrates which can cause diarrhea, gas, and bloating, often episodes of binge drinking. The common possibilities are that you have one of the above trigger which causes your gastrointestinal (GI) upsets. They can go unrecognized with episodes of symptoms as in your case. The other possibility is endometriosis. Endometrium is the lining of the uterine cavity of the female internal genital tract. In menstruation, the lining sheds causing bleeding and pain. Endometriosis is a condition where endometrial tissue is implanted into gut, and it behaves similarly as one has menstruation on monthly cycles.

Why?', 'Doctor': 'Hello, Welcome you to icliniq.com. I can imagine how upset you have been since the start of your symptoms. I will try to provide you the best options for your treatment. So far I understand that you have H.pylori induced gastritis. You have taken medications for it, but it turns positive every time you have an endoscopy, the last which was 1.5 years back. You tend to have stomach pain which is worse on fasting plus you feel burping and acidic taste in the mouth. Anal itching, and constipation worsen your itching. So H.pylori infection is common worldwide, with a prevalence of 50% of the world population is infected with this bacteria. H pylori can cause ulcers in stomach and small intestine which is called duodenum. H pylori responds to combination antibiotics for a duration of 10 to 14 days, however, due to excessive use of antibiotics in community, this bug is getting increasingly resistant to these first line antibiotics, hence, use of second line antibiotics are preferred. I will write down the treatment below in a while. Secondly, due to failure of first line antibiotic therapy, the H pylori will remain in the stomach and can cause ulcers, as well as damage to nerve cells within the wall of the stomach and cause slowing of the movement of the stomach, medically termed as gastroparesis or weakness of stomach in common words. So your symptoms may be partly defined by resistant H pylori infection causing ulcer formations particularly in duodenum plus the nerve damage within wall of stomach leading to gastroparesis causing bloating, belching, early fullness of stomach and abdominal discomfort and constipation. I want you to tell me whether your last test for H pylori was positive or negative? If positive then I recommend you to take the following therapy for 14 days. Capsule Pylera (Bismuth Subcit K-Metronidz-Tcn) three capsules daily with a glass of water three hours after meals and at bedtime, capsule Esomeprazole 40 mg once daily half an hour before meals for two weeks, Digestine 40 mg half an hour before meals daily for two weeks. If the test was negative, then I suggest you to test H pylori stool antigen to confirm if the infection is still present. If still negative then do not take capsule Pylera but continue with Esomeprazole and Digestine. The Digestine tablet will help you to improve your stomach movement. Secondly some precaution for gastroparesis try to avoid large volume meals, instead take small frequent meals. Avoid taking fatty meals such as burger, fried things, and large carbohydrate meals like potato and sweets, and soft drinks, which further slows your stomach. Avoid taking a large volume of water while having meals. Your stomach pain occurring when you are fasting for two hours is due to ulcers in duodenum, once your treatment with H pylori is completed plus acid suppressant medication such as Esomeprazole would help you to reduce your pain. I want you to upload your endoscopic reports and ultrasound reports which can help me to assess the extent of damage H pylori has caused to your stomach and duodenum. I hope this helps. Peptic ulcer disease secondary to resistant H pylori. Gastroparesis H pylori induced or idiopathic. Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth. Functional dyspepsia (post prandial distress syndrome). Stool for H pylori antigen to confirm if H pylori is still present. Gastroparesis H pylori induced or idiopathic. Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth. Functional dyspepsia (post prandial distress syndrome). Peptic ulcer disease secondary to resistant H pylori.

Both immunity and viral load are under our control. Please note that hypothyroidism or asthma will put you at a very low risk for COVID-19. So it is fine. For immunity, general good nutrition will help. There is no specific need of taking vitamin and mineral capsules for it. As regards to viral load, it can be controlled by social distancing and by reducing exposure with anybody and everybody outside your house. This rule applies to each and every member of the house. As soon as you come back home, it is advisable to have a bath with soap and water and to keep the clothes immediately for washing. When outside wear a mask covering both nose and mouth at all times.

It is always dangerous to predict and take action in case of their own health. The tinnitus in your case is not due to earwax, it may be due to the blockage of the eustachian tube (tube connecting middle ear and back of the nasal cavity, its primary work is to equalize pressure between environment and middle ear). This is also a prediction. The real cause can be found after an ear examination, as you have already mentioned nowadays it is a little hard to go for treatment. What you can do is practice some no side effect formulas. Steam inhalation, start sipping lukewarm water. For tinnitus, use resound relief app which has so many natural sound combos. Use that in speaker mode, never use earphones. Do not put oil and do not do the treatment on your own unknowingly you are worsening the conditions.

Quite a bit of wax came out, but now I have this hissing noise in my ear which gets worse when listening to podcasts and music at low-medium levels.

Please help.', 'Doctor': 'Hello. Well, I understand that a year back you have been diagnosed with gallbladder dyskinesia or dysmotility as reported by HIDA scan. I was wondering whether you have weight loss as the only primary symptom or associated with abdominal pain. Because gallbladder dyskinesia most commonly causes pain and diarrhea rather simply weight loss. Or one should have to have evidence that the weight loss was due to gallbladder dyskinesia and not otherwise, then surgery was probably the right decision. I cannot figure out whether you have other symptoms or not. And now what sort of typical symptoms you feel suggesting you as postcholecystectomy syndrome (PCS). I can understand actually that symptoms of PCS can be at times very distressing and unbearable. The common symptoms are bloating after meal, freqeunt reflux or pain in the upper part of the belly, diarrhea after meals or sometimes otherwise, and this even can cause weight loss. This syndrome basically occurs secondary to an excessive pool of bile stored within a small bowel instead of gallbladder which is otherwise a sole bile reservoir. But PCS usually resolves within some time the maximum it can take is two to three years until the time your small intestine is adapted to it. You can try tablet Cholestyramine 4 gm twice daily 1 hour before meal or 4 hours before meals. This is a bile sequestrant and will bind and remove excessive bile from the gut. To be honest, I still do not understand the reason for your surgery year back but cannot completely argue with physician because I was not and he was the best person to decide while understanding your condition at that time. Postcholecystectomy syndrome. Follow up in two weeks.  ', 'Patient': 'Hello doctor, Over a year ago, I scheduled an appointment to try to understand why I was rapidly losing weight. My gastroenterologist ran some tests and did an upper endoscopy as well as a HIDA scan. The upper turned out negative for all tests however the HIDA scan reported that my gallbladder was functioning at approximately 40%. My GI then recommended a cholecystectomy as my gallbladder was not functioning properly. He did also suggest that I could try to repair it with my diet but then told me it would likely be fruitless and I should get the procedure right away. I did so promptly and experienced the typical symptoms. I am concerned about this only now because I believe I have postcholecystectomy syndrome due to the surgery. This would not be an issue relatively however I believe that my rapid weightloss was due to extreme stress and was mostly psychological. It seems to me that my practitioner should have advised me that gallstones occur commonly when rapid weight loss occurs. Furthermore, I believe that I could have benefited much more from keeping my gallbladder on a rigorous healthy diet and prescribing a biliary control.

Blood mixed vaginal fluid in the postmenopausal women need to be evaluated cautiously and carefully. Although the common cause of such bleeding is due to deficiency of hormones once menopause is achieved, the possibility of cervical and endometrial cancer needs to be ruled out.

Before we could determine the exact cause for this prolonged bleeding, I would like to know a little more details about your previous cycles. As you said you always had regular cycles, just wanted to know if your previous period was on time and had a normal pattern of bleeding or was it scanty. Also, whether you are a sexually active individual, and if so whether any chances of pregnancy could be there? If there is any such doubt, it would be advisable to take a home pregnancy test. Sometimes the scanty flow of implantation hemorrhage could be confused with a normal period and the actual bleeding could be a sign of threatened miscarriage. If pregnancy is ruled out (by checking urine pregnancy test or if not sexually active), the hormonal disturbances of thyroid or prolactin hormones, and sometimes lifestyle-related problem that is PCOS also can cause such irregularities in periods. Also, stress can be one of the reason for hormonal changes and thus causing disturbances in menstrual patterns. Basically, this is suggestive of anovulatory cycles.

How to correct it?', 'Doctor': 'Hi. The general appearance of the nose happens to change from the beginning until the age of 18 after which it more or less remains constant unless and until there has been an external source of injury to deform the nose. If you feel that your nose looks way too weird, and it is way bothering you too much, you might require a corrective surgery that we call as a rhinoplasty. Now, depending on whether the area in concern has to be reduced or augmented, it depends on what type of nose job you want to get done and the surgeon will operate accordingly. Rhinoplasty is preserved for patients who know what changes they really have in mind and understand that a near close picture can be attained through surgery. Most nose job surgeons these days do have software wherein you can assess whats the abnormality in the nasal appearance, what changes you want and how would it probably look after the surgery. All the abnormalities mentioned above can be effectively resolved through operative rhinoplasty and conservative techniques do not really fetch long term results.  ', 'Patient': 'Hello doctor, I have a large nose which I do not really mind. However, I have one nostril bigger than the other, and my nose looks bent at the top.

My period is getting delayed this month with weight gain and increased TSH levels. Why?', 'Doctor': 'Hello. Yes, you can take the Primolut N tablet as advised by your gynecologist. As your periods have gotten delayed by almost more than 45 days, it is unlikely that they would come naturally, even if it does, it may not be similar to your natural menstrual pattern, this is because this is an anovulatory cycle (meaning no ovulation must have occurred in this cycle). Usually, when periods come after such a delay, it could range from spotting to scanty flow to excess flow, or sometimes prolonged bleeding which may need hormonal medications to stop the bleeding. I would like to know if you face any acne or unwanted facial hair growth problems, if so, then you must be having PCOS (even if the USG is normal). And yes, you definitely need to start treatment for your hypothyroidism as your TSH (thyroid-stimulating hormone) level is high. Thyroid hormonal disturbance are quite common with PCOS (polycystic ovary syndrome), and also it can disturb the menstrual pattern too. So, definitely you need to start your thyroxine replacement medications. DHEAS (dehydroepiandrosterone) is low, so there is nothing to worry about that. As you complained about weight gain over the recent few months, it would be advisable to reduce your weight, do regular exercises, and eat a proper healthy diet. I hope this helps.

I can understand you must be very upset about your mother for her troubling symptoms. You know diabetes, hypertension are chronic ailments that can affect every system of the body. Some of these effects, particularly of diabetes, are related to the gastrointestinal tract (GIT). Certain conditions like diabetic gastropathy (involving the stomach), diabetic enteropathy (when involving small bowel) can cause bloating, alternate diarrhea with constipation such as in her case. It is highly likely that she has one of two of above-mentioned conditions, but to be on the safe side I will suggest you some tests, as we can rule out anything other than this. Meanwhile, start her on tablet Digestine (Metoclopramide) 40 mg once daily half an hour before meals. Start her on tablet Rifaximin 200 mg thrice daily for three weeks. This is a safe antibiotic which will correct her abnormal bacteria within the small and large bowel. This will help her control her production in the long term. Use Fibrocol or any other fiber which is available two tablespoons full with water once daily with water. And the most important of all, tight control of her sugars. Since the problem is secondary to diabetes, once diabetes is controlled fairly enough, her symptoms improve itself. I hope this helps. Diabetic gastroparesis. Diabetic enteropathy. Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth. Functional bloating and gas. Complete blood count (CBC). HbA1c (glycated hemoglobin). TSH (thyroid-stimulating hormone), FT4, FT3. Vitamin B12, and RBC folate.

Is it due to liver damage?', 'Doctor': 'Hello. I welcome you to icliniq. First of all I give you a vote of appreciation that you were able to stop using co codamol. For chronic users of these opioid medicines, it is merely impossible to stop. Well once you stopped taking these medicines, it is unlikely that the effect will remain within you and can harm you in long term. So I do not think that you should be worried about this. Now the pain you mention which has started nearly at the time of stop of these medicines; suggest Narocotic bowel syndrome (NBS). In NBS the patient became insensitive to the usual doses of opioids and kept on increasing the doses to relieve the same amount of pain intensity with subsequent higher doses. This happen because of chronic use of these medicines would potentially increase the numbers of receptors controlling pain. Once the medicine is reduced in dose or completely stop (In your case), a rebound pain develop and it remain until another painkiller or similar opioid is restarted. So actually it is vicious cycle. Pain and increased dose cycle is sometime inevitable and requires a close monitoring of switching to other safe painkillers while at the same time decreasing the dose of opioids. The treatment is termed as Opioid detoxification therapy. To be honest, I am not an expert in it, but tried my best to explain d to you to help you understand your symptoms. If you want further guidance on how to control your pain which is possibly be secondary to NBS; I suggest you to meet with pain management specialist in near by hospital. Since you already stopped the medicines, I suggest to use Paracetomol which is rather safe medicine for controlling pain. Plus you can use Cap Pregablin 75 mg at nigh time daily to control your symptoms. I hope this will help you Take care and have a good day.

I can imagine how upset you must be about your overweight and liver issues. Well, I assume you now have a thorough idea of how this weight bears an impact on your liver. And with such amount of weight it is not uncommon to have a fatty liver disease with enlargement of liver size. The normal liver size should be no more than 13 cm. Despite the fact you have severe morbid obesity, thankfully you deserve a vote of appreciation for struggling so high to reduce your weight by 15 kg. This is a good sign by the way. I would urge you to continue this in future whatever you were doing for the weight reduction. Since you did not mention whether you still having alcohol and smoking? It is important to know that fatty liver plus alcohol can both damage the liver and the impact is much higher if both risk factors are combined. I should strongly recommend you to reduce the alcohol intake if still taking or completely stop it. Your liver may not be able to tolerate more insult because of alcohol. Now coming to the numbers which you have shared. The Kpa value more than 12 is suggestive of the development of fibrosis which is not a good sign. However, this value is often erratic or falsely high if someone has obesity or fat within the liver as may be in your case. To confirm whether you have that degree of fibrosis, you have to get a liver biopsy which can tell the exact grade of fibrosis and can differentiate whether the insult to your liver is because of alcohol you had in past, or because of fat due to obesity. The CAP value of 353 is suggestive of the amount of fat you have in the liver. This can however, indirectly confirm the damage to your liver is rather secondary to fat and not due to alcohol but again this has to be confirmed on liver biopsy. If you are not inclined to liver biopsy, I suggest you to continue with the weight reduction strategy, completely avoid alcohol intake and keep monitoring your liver function tests and fibroscan every six months.

Is there any possibility for me to get hepatitis C if condom tears during vaginal sex?', 'Doctor': 'Hello. I welcome you to icliniq. I want to know which test did you do to check Hepatitis C? If this was a high quantitative PCR test and if it was negative, then you are completely safe. If it was antibody test, and was negative, then I suggest to confrim with quantitative HCV PCR test.

I am suffering from a very bad sex life due to very low sex interest of my husband.\\xa0To tell about the past, we had a long courtship period of 1-1/2 years in which I was able to understand from his conversations that he has very low interest in sex. I ignored that and got married to him.\\xa0Right after our marriage, we had sex daily and then it started reducing gradually. The frequency fell drastically from having sex once in a week to once in 15 days.\\xa0Whenever I tried to initiate or have a word with him about it, he said that a man needs to be very free to have sex and busy people generally have low sexual engagements. I know that it is not true and I believe that he gives some excuse to his own weakness. Now, at the end of one year of our marriage, the sex has reduced to once in a month. So, you can understand the level of frustration I have landed into, which is severely affecting my own personal health and interest in staying with him. He hardly gets aroused once in many days and does not react sexually even after I make advancements. He does not react, does not understand and most importantly, not able to enter me without putting a condom. He says he gets support with the condom. So, the second issue you can understand is that with that condom I cannot conceive also. He has very low interest in anything related to sex and he is not able to enter me properly as he says it hurts him.

As there is a new lesion (with light contrast enhancement), steroids would help to relieve the tingling in the right toes.

Instead he is having me take 25 mg daily of DHEA. Do you think this will help and is it safe to take in pregnancy? Will eating foods high in phytoestrogens e.g. soy help increase my estradiol? Also, do you think my low Hcg levels are a bad sign? At 12DPO they were 15U/L so they increased rapidly to 69U/L on day 14 but then slowed a bit to get to 129U/L on day 16.

I have to have more information about this pain before I can tell you what is the cause of this pain. Usually, the gall bladder stone of such size (less than 10 mm) in size does not cause pain, and if it does, then the pain has to be characteristic one like pain starts within half hour of meals and gradually increases in intensity within next 1 hour and then start declining for the next three to six hours. Vomiting can occur with increased severity of the pain. If you have any of symptoms as mentioned, then it is possible that pain is coming from gall bladder stones, and the definitive treatment is cholecystectomy i.e. removal of the gall bladder. Again, I want to emphasize that most of the stones of such size usually do not cause pain and remain asymptomatic doing no harm to the patient throughout their life. The other cause of sudden and severe abdominal pain are ulcers within the stomach, food pipe or small bowel, inflammation of the pancreas called pancreatitis, diabetes and its complications, lead poisoning, drugs such as pain killers, and few other causes. Your lipid profile is normal, and ultrasound is otherwise normal except that stones which are clearly visible. You can start capsule Esomeprazole 40 mg half an hour before meals, it will resolve the pain if coming from ulcers in the stomach.

', 'Patient': 'Hello doctor, Approximately 4 months ago, some mild pain started in my right shoulder joint but i have not taken it seriously. It started bothering me since end of February and it was slowly worsening. I daily travel by crowded trains, approximately 25 km to my workplace and back. By middle of March, while travelling (by standing) in train holding overhead handles my shoulder was hurting with every push from the crowds at various stations. During day time, there was not much pain I felt, but in the night, my sleep was disrupted frequently with pain (like pulling with a hook) on the shoulder. I applied \"DYNAPAR QPS\" (Diclofenac Diethylamine and absolute Alchohol Non-Aqueous Topical Solution). My mother was using it for joint pains and she asked me to try it but I got no relief with it. Then my cousin practicing Homeo medicine advised me some Homeo medicines and it provided only a slight relief. In the 1st week of April, I consulted an Orthopedic (Joint pain/bone specialist) and had taken X-ray of my right hand in 2 different positions. He suggested it is due to frozen shoulder problem and advised rotation of hands, shoulders, neck, etc., along with some medicines (mainly pain killers and anti-acidity medicine). Even after taking it for 25 days, still I am having pain, mainly in the inside bend of the right-elbow. If I raise my hands straight, it hurts very little, but if I bend it to comb my hair or putting my hands through the sleeve of my shirt it hurts very badly. During day time, the pain is very minor but in the night after the sleep of an hour, it starts paining badly. What I assessed is, while the weight of the upper body rests on the shoulder or around the area (including back side) while lying down, the pain radiates from this region and it hurts mainly the shoulder joint, forearm muscles, elbow joint and the wrist. After trying various positions to rest the hand and shoulder with pillows/soft towels, the pain eases little and I fall asleep again. This repeats throughout the night. I use Laptop extensively at work and at home also. Sometimes I feel a pulling pain in the wrist when I use the mouse more, but no problem with key board.

IBS does cause a significant pain which is obvious in nature and show characteristic spasm like pain, not the burning you you described. Pain of IBS however, do occur over lower part of the abdomen.

The liver transplantation is the only definite therapy for advanced liver scarring such as in your's father case. But it is required to assign liver transplantation not too early and neither too late. There are some scoring that should be performed before recommending liver transplant. The one such score require blood investigations, radiological test such as Contrast enhanced CT scan.

To correct underlying liver, it is liver transplantation which could help.

Can you suggest how to go about it?'}, {'id': 786, 'Description': 'Q. I have bowel pain with negative calprotectin and lactoferrin tests. Why?', 'Doctor': \"Hello. I can understand you must be very upset about your ill health. So the comprehensive stool analysis is well within normal limits-particularly calprotectin and lactoferrin which are inflammatory markers. Their absence theoretically excludes any inflammation within the bowel, hence a good finding. The MRE examination and its reporting is a subjective findings means it is interpreted by a radiologist and may sometime have an error in reporting because of differential enhancement pattern within bowel and bowel movements at the time of scan, plus given your colonoscopy report afterward also showed no pathology, suggest it was possibly an error in interpretation. The colonoscopy is however, the best modality to explain the MRE (magnetic resonance electrography) reported findings. Given normal colonoscopy suggest that the possibility of inflammation is unlikely. Now coming to your symptoms and use of medication that you believe helped for some time. From your history, I understand you have been given Mesalamine for the duration of seven months after a colonoscopy that showed colitis and biopsy showed non-specific inflammation. So first of all, Mesalamine is an anti-inflammatory drug which is commonly being given among patient suffering from inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The IBD is further classified into ulcerative colitis (UC) which is a superficial inflammation usually of large bowel starting down from rectum and goes above to involve large bowel. The other one is Crohn's disease (CD) which is somewhat deeper inflammation of the gut wall having a tendency to involve almost every part of the gut starting from the mouth toward the anus. Given your symptoms of mucus or pus discharge and presence of pancolitis on one of your colonoscopy make me think that there is a possibility of ulcerative colitis. Plus the response you observed to Mesalamine is also favoring this diagnosis. Your second colonoscopy did not show any inflammation, possibly because of the remission of the disease. The UC tend to have an intermittent course with flares and intervening remissions. Possibly at the time of second colonoscopy, the disease was in remission. Given your recent stool test and recent normal colonoscopy, make me think that you do not have active disease at the moment. Your disease seems to be controlled with Budesonide or previous Mesalamine you took. The mucus/pus discharge suggests that there may be some other problem such as anal fissure, anal fistula, or anal sinus which may accompany the ulcerative colitis in its course. For this, I want you to examine your perianal (bottom) area and see from where exactly the mucus is coming. The abdominal pain may be just because of stress and anxiety accompanying the current situation and not necessarily the active disease. For such pain SSRI (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) are helpful. For treatment, I need to have the biopsy report of your colon (both the previous one and recent one), as I can see there is ongoing microscopic inflammation. Budesonide is an expensive drug and it is recommended in UC where the inflammation does not go beyond the left side of the colon. You had pan colitis (inflammation involving the whole colon) and that is why oral steroids such as tablet Prednisolone is more effective than Budesonide. The physician prescribes Budesonide over oral Prednisolone if the patient is unable to tolerate the systemic side effects which accompany oral Prednisolone, or patient has diabetes and bone mineral deficiency. Your physician probably kept this thing in mind. So to summarize: 1. You likely have ulcerative colitis because I did not see biopsy of your bowel, and as you said it was nonspecific. 2. The UC is in remission 3. The pus and mucus have to be closely examined by you or by a physician by doing a digital rectal examination. 4. The UC can frequently accompany depression and anxiety and that should be taken care of abdominal pain possibly related to stress and you consider taking SSRI at minimum dose like tablet Escitalopram 10 mg daily 5. Discuss with your primary gastroenterologist regarding oral Prednisolone if he is convinced enough. You may share your biopsy reports, I can advise you on this as well. One more thing, since you do not have any sign suggestive of active disease, the steroid are not required at the moment. You need to be given some immunosuppressive medications to control and prevent relapse/flare. The one more reason for your doctor prescribed Budesonide is he might have considered microscopic colitis which is entirely a different diagnosis and requires entirely a different management approach. You share me the biopsy and colonoscopy reports that will make me in a good position to tell you what to do now. And sorry for such a huge description and lengthy message. But I am sure this will really help you to understand your condition. I hope this helps. Ulcerative colitis in remission. Done already.

Basically report is normal (attachment removed to protect patient identity) and there is no evidence of any heart disease in the baby.

But at present, there is no evidence of any disease and usually, major diseases are not missed on fetal echo. So nothing to worry at present about the report. Now I do not know why you mentioned Down's syndrome as there is no evidence of it in echo, but routine ultrasound of the baby rather than echo is an investigation of choice for down syndrome. So routine ultrasound of the baby (called as malformation scan) is necessary to rule out down syndrome. Also, in Down syndrome, there are abnormalities in the heart as well, but echo is fine so it is a negative factor for Down syndrome, but still, ultrasound would be more reliable. Down syndrome has severe consequences on the baby rather than mother, firstly because of various structural abnormalities which may be seen in various body parts (requiring surgeries) and baby will have developmental delays, some mental retardation.

If we consider there is significant weight loss, then other specific symptoms are expected with malignancies like constipation or diarrhea, malena or symptoms pertaining to other systems if we consider issues elsewhere in the body.

Most common causes out there would be allergy or underlying sinusitis which can block up the tubes and there by cause its effects. Now getting to your question. 1. A sinus x Ray cannot show if the eustachian tubes are closed or not. A sinus x Ray just gives information about the status of the sinuses, septum and other bony prominence. 2.

Your observation that sometimes you can take a deep breath that is a bit more satisfying than other times makes me a bit more curious as to whether you are in the same posture every time you try it. The diaphragm is a muscle that divides everything in chest from everything in the belly with a few orifices that help get certain things like your food pipe through. It helps to expand the lungs by moving towards the belly while to take a breath in thereby creating more space for the lungs. Since there is a finite potential space, I wonder if you feel the difference based on how much food you have had or what time of day is it. I suggest a more detailed discussion if you can provide some more information.

Would you recommend pranayama for a 90 year old?', 'Doctor': \"Hi. Thanks for posing this question. Please find my suggestions below. At age 90, it becomes very important to keep the things simple for the patient. Your effort to teach pranayama is appreciable. I would advise you not to go for any difficult pranayama which is tedious to understand. Nadi suddhi and anuloma viloma or alternate nostril breathing is sometimes confusing for elderly people. If the above option is also found to be difficult, then just ask him to follow breath awareness, where one just needs to focus on breath without any active effort for its manipulation either sitting or lying. Exhaling through the mouth is perfectly fine as far as the patient is comfortable. But, there is nothing wrong in exhaling through the nose also. Let it be decided by the patient whether he wants to exhale through the mouth or through the nose. Both ways of exhaling seems to be equally good with a bit extra priority to exhaling through the mouth. Let us not trouble him by putting any unnecessary rules. I will consider bhramari pranayama (chanting of Nnnn while exhaling) to be best for him. If any religious concerns are there about any of the chanting, then these can be replaced with either only bhramari pranayama or instead of Om some other words like swim can be followed with emphasis on ''Mmmm'' sound and very minimal ''swi'' sound. Any other similar words or chants can be chosen. Treatment proposed here is to be followed under supervision and several modifications or omissions and replacements may be needed for different individuals with same ailment or same individual at different stages of ailment.

He has congestive heart failure and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. He is generally in good spirits and is well taken care of. He uses oxygen and his doctors have told him that when his oxygen count goes down, to breathe in and exhale through mouth. Since his breathing is generally weak, after every time he walks or climbs stairs, he sits down with this oxygen tank and breathes in slightly and then exhales, usually with more force than he inhaled. I am trying to teach my mother about pranayama and the importance of exhaling through the nose. Her concern is that the doctors have taught them the breath in through nose technique and exhale through the mouth. Given that he is 90 with those conditions, on oxygen, is there a reason that he should use the technique the doctors are recommending? Would it be more beneficial to breath in through the nose and exhales slowing through the nose, even with the tubes in his nose?

I first removed the protein supplement from my diet thinking it was the cause and only 1-2 weeks later realized upon the research that creatine was the real culprit. I instantly stopped taking it and the only supplement I take now is natural, dairy free protein powder. Along with the skin care regimen, I follow this every day. I am using a cleanser along with moisturizer twice a day and it has helped almost to clear my forehead and temples. I assumed my breakouts were due to dehydration in the period I was taking creatine, but only noticed slight progress in my chin area. Although, the bumps on my skin now do not feel as tough and dry as they did and do not itch anymore unless I forget to moisturize. I drink lots of water and have just bought a 97% pure aloe vera gel tube that I am going to apply twice a day. I am afraid whether this condition could last a long time after quitting creatine.

This would only occur with the harder stools. The other stools seem to be softer and more yellowish in color. After the CT scan, I am of course going to the bathroom frequently, but no white in stool at that time. So, my concern is the mucus which I have never had before. What is causing the diarrhea? Ironically, I had seen my gastro doctor when all of this began. So, I have scheduled another appointment. I had a colonoscopy two years back, all normal except for hemorrhoids and an upper GI at the same time. Gastritis was the only thing found.

It is very unlikely that you develop a sinus infection following consumption of any food. However, if your prone for a post nasal drip after consuming anything for that matter, it could be related to a food allergy what we categorise as NINAR (non infectious non allergic rhinitis). Post nasal drip occurs due to accumulation of mucus in the nose which has no place to go other than being blown out or pushed into the throat which often causes irritation and frequent throat clearing. I do not really suggest any treatment for this. You take steam, have warm water and do saline gargles to get rid of the irritation temporarily.

Your height is almost the average of your parents. At 15-17 years in males growth plates close and then there is no increase in height possible after that. You are almost in that age. Do you have any other symptoms of impaired secondary sexual characteristics? You can have bone age checked if you want to confirm it. Oxandarolone is an anabolic steroid.

Some people using Oxandrolone have developed life-threatening side effects on the liver, spleen, and blood vessels. These conditions can occur without warning or symptoms and can lead to liver failure, internal bleeding, cancer, stroke, heart attack, or death.

If the Doppler scans are not showing the varicocele it might be at an initial stage. It is a good option to get your semen analysis done, this will help you to find out if there is any problem with your sperms but will not rule out the cause that is a varicocele. It is advisable to get follow up Doppler at three months interval but I would not recommend surgery just yet, especially, if you have completed a family and you already have children. Surgery is a necessity if your hydrocele increases in size and causes discomfort or a varicocele is found on the Doppler scan of the scrotum, or immediate surgery is advisable if your sperm count is low after ruling out other causes for a lower sperm count.

After five days, I notice a swelling that is not round in shape and close to the left testicles. The urologist did another scan for scrotal Doppler. The report is the same as the first one. Only a left mid hydrocoele was found. The doctor said, he is surprised that the scan has not picked up varicoceles. Because he noticed left varicoceles when he feels it. I can feel the right varicocele is small than the left varicocele. He asked me to go to another hospital for a scan and mostly they should check for varicoceles. Surprisingly, the third Doppler scan for scrotal in another hospital seen nothing wrong, and the investigation was normal. The urologist says, since the three reports have picked up nothing and no varicoceles are found, he could not operate on it. That this is because the varicocele is not large enough to cause problem for the Doppler to see. I asked the doctor whether I should go for a semen analysis to see if the semen is normal. He says that is a good suggestion to rule out every suspicious of varicocele and my sperm count is normal. I ask him about the swelling close to the testicles, he said, that is normal and I should relax and it will not affect my testicles. Do you think I should be relaxed about this? Is the doctor right?

When a tooth decays and when the nerve layer of the tooth is affected, it starts to give out pain and it loses its vitality becoming more brittle. Hence it could have fractured. Also, to save such tooth, root canal treatment will be performed.  Mild pain/discomfort after RCT is quite normal for the next 3 to 5 days for which you would have been put under pain killers. This period is for tooth healing and it is essential that you do not disturb or bite food on that tooth. Once it completely heals, crown procedure is generally performed.

Can you get infected by coming in contact with someone with leprosy?', 'Doctor': \"Hello It is very commendable of you to find out more about this disease. A lot of stigma is associated with the disease and its sufferers. Common public just sees those people as untouchables or a taboo. It is a bacterial infection caused by Mycobacterium leprae. The organism is similar to TB bacteria and so their treatments are also similar and run for months together. But the treatment and drugs are not the same. The laprosy bacteria produces lesions in skin, mucous membranes, eyes, nerves and tissues. Gradually untreated lesions spread inside and affect nerves causing their swelling and loss of sensation. Slowly the body resorbs the extremities and thats why you see a lot of untreated patients having loss of digits and toes. You might have found a lot of people with saddle nose deformity also. The transmission of leprosy with what is known occurs after prolonged and close contact with untreated leprosy patients over months. It doesn't spread that easily or fast. You dont contract it from ground or soil. You dont get it if you touch an object touched by a leper. Nor would you get the disease if you hug the patient. There is very minimal to no risk in contracting the disease from patients who are outside. However, avoid prolonged contact with the patients. Wear a mask always when you are outside, considering the current situation. Recently there is some evidence suggesting the disease may be spread by droplets, like sneezes or coughs or bodily fluids. But nothing has been concluded. It is best to avoid close personal contact with a patient and wear a mask to prevent droplet infection.

To taper off the Levetiracetam - if you have not experienced any seizure or aura in the last four years then we can go straight away with gradual tapering of the medicine, for that we need to know the last seizure/ aura episode, but with this, there is a risk of recurrence, you need to be cautious and under the watch of someone for few months. 2. Substitute Levetiracetam with Sodium valproate - in this risk of seizure is less, but still, it is there, on the fact the Sodium valproate is a mood stabilizer.

Please help.', 'Doctor': 'Hello. Regarding the treatment, I suggest you continue the medicines as they are. I would like to know how much of Prednisolone did you start with? Nextly, you must start on intranasal steroids to help relieve the nasal symptoms. Use Fluticasone furoate twice daily two puffs in each nostril twice daily. The brands available in the Philippines are Avamys, Flutiair, Nasoflo, Flusort. If you feel the antihistaminics are making you drowsy, then you may keep the Cetirizine for the evening and take Loratidine in the morning. Apply a mild steroid cream like Betamethasone valerate 0.1% topical cream over the affected skin. The brands available in your country are Diprolene, Diprosone, and Betnovate. Long term solution: You must do a skin prick testing to check what you are allergic to. Skin prick testing is better than blood allergy testing. Both the methods check for food and aeroallergens. Remember that before the testing you should stop the antihistaminics for five days. With such a test we will come to know the offending agent and give you the right advice to prevent that particular allergen. Do revert back for more details.

Based on your description, I understand that you skin using the pills in early last month, in the beginning of your menstrual cycles and later took it continuously to avoid the placebo pills. See, first thing you have to understand is that , if you didn't start the birth control in the first week of your menstrual cycles it's not effective as a birth control at all as the follicular development already sets in which contains the Ovum (egg). So there is a high chance of pregnancy in such cases even if you start it in the following week. The clots that you described could be possibly products of Conception ( only a possibility) if you had gotten pregnant and had a spontaneous miscarriage. So to confirm if this is the situation or not, please check your home pregancy test. If that is positive then this confirms the likely possibility of a pregnancy. Also if you could share a picture of the clot that you have I can have a look to check the other possibilities of your problem. Please feel free to revert back to me anytime with any further queries or doubts. Also please check your home pregancy test once and get back to me with the result.

Because of my current circumstances, I have not taken birth control the \"normal\" way in the last two months. Early last month, I did not have more birth control at the end of my placebo week, and was only able to start a new cycle of it the following week. I did not know I should only start the pill at the beginning of my cycle. Once I found out, I skipped the placebo week the following month in order to reset the \"ovulation\"/placebo timings. I am sexually active and, knowing I had not used the pill correctly, I mostly used condoms as backup.

He was confident enough that he advised me not to go for any testing. Although my fear of infection remained. Around two months post-exposure, I felt tenderness here and there like on the back of my head, arms, one lymph node in my underarm was swollen and I developed cold and cough.

Is it due to liver failure?', 'Doctor': 'Hello. I welcome you to icliniq. I can understand you must be very upset about your father. The history you provided provides a little clue to what excatly he is sufferring with. Non visible blood in urine is called microscopic hematuria. Some liver condition can cause this problem such as Hepatitis C viral infection , hepatitis B viral infection, recent drug use, or advanced liver disease secondary to any cause. with advanced liver disease platelets (white cells in blood which control bleeding) are decreased that why patient is prone to develop bleeding from any site- may be in urine, skin or sometime internally within abdomen. The swelling you mentioned possibly be secondary to fluid collection over legs and which resolves with medications called diuretics which increase urine formation. If these all findings combined It is possible that your father is suffereing from liver cirrhosis also called scarring of liver. Dear, the liver cirrhosis requires a long term management with initially medical and supportive treatment followed by liver transplant which is the definite therapy.

I have right-sided head, neck, and shoulder pain. Please suggest treatment.', 'Doctor': 'Hi. I can understand your concern. According to your statement, you have been suffering from right-sided head, neck, and shoulder pain. Most head, neck, and shoulder pain is resulted from sprains and strains by incorrect posture or mechanical injury due to daily works. It may result from soft tissue injury (including muscle, tendons, ligaments, etc). Again nerve injury of these area can produce head, neck, and shoulder pain. Displacement of cervical disc can produce same type of symptoms known as herniated or prolapsed disc. Rotator cuff tendons hold your arm with shoulder and rotator cuff tear which is caused by sports or overuse can produce head, neck, and shoulder pain. Inflammation of tendons (tendonitis) or bursa (bursitis) of these areas also can produce the same type of clinical symptoms. Again heart attack, angina, stroke, cervical artery dissection, etc., can present the same type of clinical symptoms. Treatment depends on causes. So you should undergo some investigations like an x-ray of cervical spine, CT scan or MRI of cervical spine, RBS (random blood sugar), CBC (complete blood sugar), USG (ultrasound) of the hepatobiliary system with blood pressure monitoring, etc., to find out the underlying the causes which are responsible for your suffering and then treat them accordingly. For your head, neck, and shoulder pain you can take Naproxen plus and Esomeprazole combination (twice daily) with Baclofen (twice daily) with calcium plus vitamin D combination (once daily). Please inform me of the results after undergoing the investigations and then I will be able to help you further.  ', 'Patient': 'Hello doctor, I am a 27-year-old female.

Why?', 'Doctor': \"Hello. I welcome you to icliniq. I can understand you must be very upset about your problem. Well the symptoms you mention seem to be occurring due to irritable bowels. The irritable syndrome is a gastrointestinal entity where patient has abdominal pain which change with physiologic activities such as defecation, belching. This abdominal pain can accompany diarrhea, which is called as Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) diarrhea (D) predominant (IBS-C) to be precise. The blood test, urine test, and Ultrasound abdomen that you shared are very much within normal limits. So don't be worry at moment. You said stool test contain macrophages, but I can't see any stool detail report among files you uploaded. Well macrophages or leuckocytes can be present in stool harmlessly and does not suggest any diagnosis by its own. I would recommend you to get some more stool test that can determine it clearly. So the IBS usually affects small and large bowel; and it is not uncommon to have concomitant stomach irritation which is called functional dyspepsia. So part of your symptoms such as stomach cramps, bloating are secondary to stomach irritation. You are on lots of medications, many with similar drug class, that does not seem a wise to continue for now. I just recommend you some medication you can use them and let me know in one week time how that work in your case.

I get recurrent cold sores which are not healing completely. Why?', 'Doctor': 'Hi. As per your information and photographs (attachment removed to protect patient identity), I can see there is swelling and some small pus-filled rash and small scars. If it is recurrent then there are some possibilities like herpes labialis, cyclic neutropenia, neutrophilic dermatoses (localized), granulomatous cheilitis. Yes, punch skin biopsy will give a more close clue for diagnosis. Along with it, you need to do Tzanck smear from lip area, CBC (complete blood count), absolute neutrophil count, and ANCA (anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody). Do you have diabetes or high blood pressure or on any medicines for the same? Or any other complaint? From your detailed information, recurrent herpes labialis or neutrophil (WBC) related skin disorder are more possible. Tingling, and pain indicate nerve fiber involvement which is more possible in herpes virus infection.

Please help.', 'Doctor': 'Hello. I read your query and understand your concerns. First of all, I like to inform you that anxiety disorder is a treatable disorder during current times as a lot of medications are available in this regard. As I can see you are taking two medications for the same but unfortunately dose of both medications is at lower limits. I also feel instead of two medications it will be ideal to have one medication with proper dosage. For example dose of Daxid (Sertraline) is 50-200 mg per day and the dose of Mirtazapine is 15-60 mg for most individuals. In my opinion, you need to discuss the optimization of dose with your treating psychiatrist. As I can see there are issues with stomach bloating and constipation. Mirtazapine needs to be avoided as far as possible. This is because abdominal side effects along with constipation are very common especially among the elderly. There is also a possibility that your medications for CAD or diabetes contributing to the current problem. For that purpose I feel you need to discuss same with your cardiologist. In addition to medications, there is a need for stress management. I can see that you have excessive concern about the ongoing medical illness. First of all, we need to acknowledge that these two conditions are treatable and with appropriate care you can have near optimal life.To smoothen the stress management, I am writing down a few of the strategies that will help you. 1. Diet: Ensure intake of adequate quantity of fiber. Two servings of vegetable salad and two servings of fruits (one preferable citrus fruit). Avoid junk food and fast food especially pizza, burgers, and excessive sweets. 2. Ensure adequate water intake. Recommended intake of water is two to three liters a day. Insufficient intake of water could be a contributing factor in the causation of symptoms. 3. Early morning exercise and brisk walking for 30 minutes at a stretch preferably in the garden will be very helpful. 4. Avoid tea, coffee, nicotine, and alcoholic beverages. If at all you want to drink something, drink fresh lime water. It is very much refreshing. 5. Start your day with a glass of lemon water with two spoons of honey added. Have a good breakfast. 6. Do not take work so seriously. We all have the feeling to excel in our respective fields and do not spend adequate time with our own self trying to understand our own needs. Spend time with your family and friends. 7. While working take frequent regular breaks. I will advise you to take a break of 5-10 minutes after every 50-55 minutes. Close your eyes and rotate the eyeballs for a couple of minutes. 8. Avoid starring for a longer time at the computer screen or TV. 9. Steam inhalation before going to sleep will be very refreshing. It will also benefit. 10. Take multivitamin and calcium supplement. I hope this helps.  ', 'Patient': 'Hello doctor, Anxiety disorder, bloated stomach, and constipation are troubling me.

Infections less frequently passed on include chlamydia, HIV and hepatitis A. But, I must tell you that the risks of getting an STD from unprotected oral sex are typically much lower than the risks posed by having unprotected vaginal or anal sex. This is because saliva often contains the antibacterial and antiviral agents. I think of a rescreen if it persists for more than a week or changes its behavior as you never know how you could contract STD.

Since you are already taking Xanax (Alprazolam) I assume that you have this problem for a longtime and it is possible that there will be required to increase the dose in the near future. You also mentioned heart arrhythmia. In that situation we need to be very slow. First, start with 5 mg than 7.5 mg or 10 mg as there are problems encountered by those who has a heart problem. I do not mean there is a serious risk, but caution is warranted. In case if you develop side effects, then there is some possibility of headache, gastrointestinal disturbance and giddiness, which are most common. Regarding the suitability of treatment, I do not find any fault with prescribed treatment as Escitaopram a SSRI (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor), is used for definite treatment of GAD (generalized anxiety disorder) while Clonazepam helps in initial management of anxiety till Escitalopram takes over.

Please help.', 'Doctor': 'Hello,  Welcome to icliniq.com. I can imagine how difficult time you have doing all these visit to doctors. Well, I have gone through your history, I could not see you have any specific gastrointestinal issues at this moment. Your main concerns are related to the neurological department not a gastroenterology department. I urge you to seek help from a neurology team. Well, some of your concerns like fatty liver, and indigestions are related to my field, hence I would like to give you some suggestion regarding that. So I see you already on some medicine for indigestion such as Maalox syrup and Pariet which is an acid suppressant medication. They are relatively safe and can be taken regularly or intermittently based on symptoms. The second concern from GI prespective are fatty liver. You did not mention your weight so I could not estimate the body mass index which is a direct tool to assess the level of fat one has over the liver and other body tissues. Atorvastatin (Lipitor) can reduce some fat from liver but they are not the preferred treatment for fatty liver disease, they can control lipids however if elevated. Atorvastatin can cause myopathy means muscle damage and can cause severe cramps over legs and throughout the body. I want you to check your creatine phosphokinase (CPK) levels to confirm this if you have recently stopped your Atorvastatin. The preferred therapy for fatty liver disease, if you are not diabetes is Vitamin E 400 mg twice daily for at least three months. The other recommendation is to reduce your weight by 7 to 10% of current body weight in the coming six months. Walk 150 minutes/week and dieting which is all required. I am sorry I could not answer the rest of your concern, but I want that should contact a neurologist available online on icliniq to be given proper suggestions regarding your health. I hope this helps. Fatty liver disease. Indigestion. Creatine phosphokinase. Drug-induced indigestion. Capsule Vitamin E 400 mg twice daily for three months. You can follow up with me for your GI related issues, and discuss long term management of your fatty liver disease.  ', 'Patient': 'Hello doctor, I had a problem with lower left abdominal pain for 7 years which is diagnosed in 2017 as an umbilical hernia. I subsequently did the surgery in January 2018 and I was diagnosed with moderate fatty liver during the test prior to the surgery. But I was given Liv 52 to take for three months and Lipitor 20 mg. But when I reported to work I started noticing mild pain in my heels and imbalance which I thought was due to the drugs side effects. Somewhere in March I panicked out of sleep and started sweating with my heart beating very fast. I rushed to the hospital and they did a brain CT and kidney function test which was normal and the gave me some anxiety tablets Lexotamil 1.5 mg. Afterward, I noticed that my heel pain was aggravating with flashes of dizziness and minor headaches which I could manage. I reported to the hospital and was referred to an orthopedic specialist. There I was asked to do and MRI of the brain, neck, and spine with magnesium, phosphate, calcium, and sodium test which were all normal. The doctor then gave me Renerve and Stugeron for the dizziness. But still the issue persisted so I reported back to focus and was asked to see and ENT specialist and EYE specialist. I went to an eye center but they all proved negative. So I was referred to see a neurologist who asked for an MRI of the thoracic and lumbar spines and also test for Folate and Vitamin B12. But again they were all negative and he said my situation might be idiomatic so he did not give anything. But in all these, I realized my energy levels were coming down I easily get tired and occasionally my heart rate will go up with a feeling of uneasiness and confusion all coupled with balancing disorders associated with cluster headaches. I went back to my hospital and was advised to see a cardiologist. He also did his relevant test which all proved negative and he declared me safe. But he advised if I am still not normal I should see his boys at the executive heart center which I did. They have been working on me since and nothing has come up. Although the symptoms still persist. So just last week I was not feeling very well and had to go for a check up when I was told of the micro-pulmonary embolism and was admitted. I currently have serious heel pain without swelling in the legs, dizziness without spinning, chest discomfort, unsteady gait, muscle weakness and extreme fatigue, diminished vision, issues with acid reflux and indigestion, occasional heart palpitations, insomnia, and pressure and discomfort in the chest after standing for about 5 minutes or while walking with extreme dizziness. I currently take Xarelto 15 mg, Motilium once daily, Stugeron 25 mg, Maalox plus suspension 150 ml, Pariet 20 mg, Carvedilol 6.25 mg, and Lexotanil 1.5 mg once daily at night.'}, {'id': 985, 'Description': 'Q.

Nasopharyngeal swab for Coronavirus is a very simple test just like how you use your ear buds. So nèed not worry, it can be done even if you have deviated septum. At this pandemic season, it is recommended by world health officials and your employer can demand you to get tested before joining your work as you have traveled overseas and 14 days quarantine is also recommended by World Health Organization.

I am already on day 10 of Quarantine but they want to do the test. Is there any risk for me to do this test considering the previous surgeries? Can they force me to do the test?

I am diagnosed with ulcerative proctitis and suppositories do not work for me. Why?', 'Doctor': 'Hello. I can imagine how upset you are about your disease. Thankfully it is limited to the rectum and not extensive to involve the left side of the colon. I am sure that your previous gastroenterologist had done biopsy of the rest of colon to exclude microscopic activity in other segments of the colon. So if suppository is not working I suggest you to use Mesalamine enema. You can use 2 grams enema once a day preferably in morning after passing the first stool. Not thrice a day. The once a day dose work fine. Actually suppositories may not reach up to the extend of disease, hence in such situation enema which are rather liquid preparation would work fine. Plus you should add Hydrocortisone enema 100 mg once daily at night time. You can use Hydrocortisone enema for two weeks and Mesalamine enema regularly. The picture you uploaded (attachment removed to protect patient identity) suggestive of blood with lots of mucus. I also want to recommend to test stool for C difficle antigen, and blood IHA titers for E.histolytica, if any of those infections are found would require antibiotic therapy in addition to the above therapy.

I have depression for 32 years, but I am more depressed with my recent TBS. Why?', 'Doctor': 'Hello. I read your query and understand your concerns. Although it is too early to measure the effect of TBS (theta-burst stimulation) after the nine sessions there is a good possibility that there will be an enduring effect over the coming weeks. My statement is based on the fact that early response (may be transient one) is an indicator of long term response for most antidepressant therapies including medications, TMS (transcranial magnetic stimulation), ECT (electroconvulsive therapy) and now rTMS (repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation), and TBS.  Considering the above fact I like to state that reversal of symptoms after a few days of normalcy at this stage is considered normal and we need to hold on till the completion of therapy. Although this is not the part of the question I like to draw your attention to the suboptimal dose of Effexor for someone who has depression over the 30 years. I rarely see any patient who responds to below 150 mg of Effexor after a prolonged history of depression, say 30 years. I hope this helps.

Please take an antireflux tablet such as tablet Pantoprazole 40 mg once in the morning before breakfast. Along with this, I suggest you to apply Candid ear drops three drops thrice a day.

I suggest you do further work up for anemia with serum ferritin, serum iron, peripheral smear examination, and USG abdomen. You can consult a nearby pediatrician once for physical examination.

I have gone through the query with keen interest and understand your concerns. Before making any opinions I need to inform you that take the things in objective manner and not on emotions I understand there is history of autism in the family and it does not mean your child suffers with autism. In a normal growing child there are many ups and downs and not responding on some occasions is not indicative of serious pathology like autism. We need to take notice that a child plays well with another child, responds to language on most occasions, cheerful, not having any abnormal repetitive stereotyped movements and communicates with the mother. Having said this I feel it will be appropriate to fill a simple questionnaire called Autism Spectrum Screening Questionnaire (ASSQ). This is a screening instrument for autism and you will know probably with sure that whether there is problem or not. If you still feel there is something abnormal, then you may contact the specialist doctor nearby for a physical evaluation.

But, mom and dad insist on reminding me of everything you see them that my son is also the possibility of getting hurt. I started since 10 months; I am watching my son very much. I blame him if he did not implement what I am asking. He says dad and mom. He loves to play, laugh and shake hands if I asked him to do so. He looks into my eyes when I talk, but I do not feel that he understands what I am saying to him always. For example, if I asked him to bring me cheesed off the table,\\xa0he does not focus with me and ignore me. On the other hand, if he feels he is thirsty, then he will come to me and say a bottle of water. I know this is probably because the rate of a normal IQ and concentration varies from one to another child. I want a word from the doctor that makes me serenely scream in the face of all of the notes that my son is not normal and I tell them that my son safe and sound.

I understand your concern but I think as so much time has already passed and by God's grace everything is fine then I think it has not gone into the airway, problem erupts only when it gets stuck in the airway, it might have gone down through the digestive tract and shall pass out normally through faeces. The biggest question is whether it went inside along with breath or food? That will surely subside the confusion and the one who swallowed most probably can feel this. I would surely want to know which number tooth it belonged to in order to know whether it was bigger or smaller in size. Anyway, an X-ray is always advisable for safety if your area is now open for the same. Be careful and look for the engulfed crown in your passed out fecal matter that will also relax you if you find it sooner. It mostly passes out in 24-48 hours. You can have banana so as to help it pass digestive tract smoothly.  \", 'Patient': 'Hello doctor, My friend had accidentally swallowed tooth crown an hour ago, she is not facing any problem till now, what should she do, kindly advise.'}, {'id': 1044, 'Description': 'Q.

People taking Alprazolam should not combine it with alcohol and avoid combining it with other medications, such as narcotic pain relievers, that cause drowsiness. Doing so can cause additive drowsiness and reduced breathing as well as other side effects, which can be dangerous and possibly fatal. Alprazolam may be habit-forming when taken for long periods of time. If you have been taking this medication regularly for a long period of time (more than one month), do not stop taking the medication without speaking with your doctor. A gradual reduction in dose is recommended when stopping this medication to avoid withdrawal symptoms.  Escitalopram works by blocking the reuptake of serotonin so that there is an increased level in the brain. Serotonin is an important neurotransmitter responsible for mood and well being. It is usually taken once daily and may take a few weeks to months reach maximum therapeutic potential. So continue taking Escitalopram until you see significant improvements in your memory.

I did not take the drug every day and after roughly two months I quit the drug altogether, the withdrawal, that I did not recognize at the time, kicked in (Extreme tinnitus, sweating, heart racing, heightened anxiety). I went to ENT doctor and she gave me two Dexamethasone injections in 3 days (I think 8 mg). I developed during these 3 days a major loss of short term and then long term memory, trouble finding words, trouble learning in general. The physical symptoms of the steroids and benzo withdrawal went away in 2 weeks. It has now been a month since I feel physically fine, but the cognitive issues persist and they do not get better at all. I have been to a psychiatrist because I felt overwhelmed that Iam not going to be able to finish school in such a state and she gave me Escitalopram thinking it could be psychological, but there is no improvement in cognition after a months use.

According to your statement, you have been suffering from a tiny hard spot on the head of the penis. This type of tiny spot can result from various reasons such as mole produced from over secretion of melanin by skin cells. They are harmless and nothing to be worried. Penile papule appears around the penis head which does not itch or produce any fluid. They may disappear as time passes. Angiokeratoma is a tiny red bump that appears when blood vessels near your penile skin become dilated. They are rough in nature and may become thicker over time. Lymphocele has resulted from blockage in the lymph channel near your penile head. It does not need any treatment and dissolves over time. Peyronie's disease is resulted from scar tissue which is found on the top of the penis that tends to harden due to calcium deposition. Treatment is needed when it makes erection of the penis difficult. Again your penile tiny hard spot may be resulted from a pimple, cyst, or STD (sexually transmitted disease). As your penile spot does not create any difficulty in your regular performance so it is nothing to be worried and needs no treatment. I think it will disappear over time. You can undergo FNAC (fine needle aspiration cytology) or biopsy from a tiny hard spot on the top of your penile head.  \", 'Patient': 'Hello doctor, I have a tiny hard spot on the head of my penis.

Well, the whole blood and serum (white fluid within blood) contains large amount of virus, and virus can live on blood spots outside the human body for the duration of one week. So actually it depends upon how much blood, and how much time it has been on the stain that can determine the chances of acquiring infection if contaminated with food. So I guess my answer can be partially answering your query. If you tell me the exact event I may be in a better position to tell you the figures. Otherwise, as a general rule, hepatitis B does not spread via food, having said that, it can still spread if blood contaminated food has been ingested. Since virus invades the human body when comes in close to mucosa (lining of our mouth) and then spread to blood within human. This happens in the same way as one infected person can transmit infection via kissing, hugging, sharing of a towel, spoon, plates, and so on. If you are puzzled with all that information, I want you to simply get a blood test for hepatitis B infection. It is a simple blood test that can give us a clue. I hope this helps.

The systemic side effects of cardioselective beta-blockers are less compared to the general beta-blockers.

I see that you are worried about discharge from both your breasts and you are telling it has blister-like appearance. White discharge with blister-like appearance and sore to touch generally points towards an infection, but an infection occurring simultaneously in both breasts at the same time is very rare. Another possibility, is that milk secretion from both breasts which you might think as white discharge. Do not doubt, there are certain conditions where there can be milk secretion even without pregnancy and birth, which occurs due to hormone disturbances. Need some more information too, Do you have a fever? How are your menstrual cycles? Is it regular? Is the flow high? Do you feel any small lump behind the nipples? Do you take medicines for any other problem? Do not mistake me, but your problem needs a direct clinical examination to visualize the breast, discharge and to see if there are any lumps behind the nipples. You would not be comfortable to post pictures of your discharge and blisters, so I would recommend you to visit a doctor in person and have yourself examined.

First of all, let me tell you that visual development takes until the age of puberty. As your child grows, his vision parameters will change because his eyeball grows with him as he ages. So visual stability will continue to change until the age of 18-20 years old. Normally the child is born with a plus refractive error unlike the case here. Your child has a condition called myopia which is a refractive error with a minus as you said. But that is completely fixable as the child grows whether by glasses, contact lenses, or LASIK surgery if it continues and he needs to take glasses off later. The most important examination in his age is something called a red reflex. You should ask your doctor if he has done it to him. Also, I would ask about the fundus examination too. If both were normal, I would not have any concerns. I want to reassure you that your child's eyes are in good health. He just needs to be examined precisely every follow up every six months as your doctor suggested, just to make sure everything is going right and to treat anything if something happens early. The glasses will not be tolerated by a child as his age is too small, as soon as he can tolerate glasses, put them on. That could happen in two years. If you need further assistance do not hesitate to contact me.  \", 'Patient': 'Hello doctor, My child is one year old.

First this to rule out is a foreign body in the eye. For that ask someone to examine your eye with a torchlight and also check the upper lid by everting it because that is the common site for foreign body. Sometimes a very small foreign body cannot be seen with the naked eye and need an eye exam by a doctor. Wash your eye with clean water. If there is no foreign body seen then it is most probably conjunctivitis (that presents with the same symptoms) usually viral conjunctivitis. It usually takes 7-10 days to complete recovery but during this period protect your other eye and other family members because it spreads from one person to another through contact. For symptomatic relief, keep washing your eyes with cold water and do icepacks. That helps to relieve discomfort. Start antibiotic (Moxifloxacin 0.5%) eye drops four times a day to avoid secondary infection. If pain and discomfort are severe consult your nearby eye doctor for a complete eye exam.

My pregnancy test showed two faint lines. Should I go to the doctor or wait for a week?', 'Doctor': \"Hello, Welcome to Icliniq. I see than you haven't mentioned the date of your last menstrual period. Ideally, if you have had a regular 28days cycles, the urine pregnancy test is usually positive by the time you skip your periods. Delayed ovulation can be common in PCOS, So, I would suggest you to recheck your home pregancy test with an early morning urine sample tomorrow, and exactly at the time interval at which the result has to be read as mentioned on the kit. Sometimes if seen very late , the evaporation line also may seem as faintly positive which is actually a false positive. Early morning urine sample is supposed to be having concentrated levels of the Beta HCG hormone which is detected on the pregnancy kit. So recheck again tomorrow with a morning sample of urine. If you donot have any pain or spotting, you can visit your Gynaecologist at ease, may be in a week, and get an ultrasound done for pregnancy viability and localisation. Meanwhile continue taking folic acid & Eltroxin Medications & recheck your thyroid levels as during the pregnancy the dose may have to be changed due to increased requirements in pregnancy. Hope this helps.

Lisinopril HCTZ (Hydrochlorothiazide) is a combo of two drugs in which HCTZ has erectile dysfunction as one of its side effects. Hydrochlorothiazide need to be replaced with a different drug or removed. You are on three antihypertensives Lisinopril, HCTZ, and Amlodipine. Is your hypertension that severe?

The erectile effects of Sildenafil are short lasting whereas Tadalafil has prolonged effects and one pill on Friday will make you have a wholesome weekend.

First of all, there is no harm in taking Duphaston in your condition. It is just a progesterone hormonal analog, the same hormone is secreted from the ovaries once the egg is released after ovulation. So there is nothing to worry about taking it. I would like to know what was the indication for checking beta hCG (human chorionic gonadotropin) value at 37th-day post-abortion, when everything was fine, you even got your periods pretty much on time? Regarding your beta hCG value, I would like to tell you that beta hCG may be detected in maternal blood up to 4-6 weeks post first-trimester miscarriage or medical abortion. Did you had a missed miscarriage or was it an unwanted pregnancy that was terminated medically, and at how many weeks of gestation? This is important because sometimes missed miscarriage may harbor partial molar pregnancy which goes unnoticed, as biopsy or histopathological examination is not done for such cases. But yes, any persistence beyond 6 weeks of abortions should be monitored carefully as these may be a hint of development of gestational trophoblastic neoplasia (GTN). As your scan is normal, and also endometrial thickness of 3 mm is also a normal finding, so there is no chance of having any retained products. It would be helpful if you could share the ultrasound reports (pre and post-abortion), and the dates of the events along with the date of doing beta hCG levels to have a better idea of your situation.

But the details are a little confusing, it would have been good if you could give details with dates when beta hCG (human chorionic gonadotropin) was checked. I understand that scans were performed and the beta hCG test on 8th May is 178 and on 10th May it was 247. On 13th May you got the scan as you had a spotting, right? See, as your previous cycles have been irregular, it is difficult to predict when you would have ovulated exactly. So we cannot go by your dates to calculate the duration of the pregnancy. May I know when did the urine pregnancy test turn positive for the first time? It would be advisable to recheck your urine pregnancy test now again, as you had spotting, if the levels are falling then it would be suggestive of a miscarriage, and mostly this could be like a biochemical pregnancy, where pregnancy is detected only in the blood tests, but on the scan I cannot find the gestational sac development, which has ultimately got aborted. (As levels you mentioned last were pretty low). Another possibility to be ruled out, more importantly, is ectopic pregnancy or pregnancy at some unknown location.

I have fever and leg pain from yesterday with a history of preauricular sinus. Please help.', 'Doctor': 'Hello. I have gone through your query. As per your query, you have taken multiple antibiotics for a long time which is not good. I need to know whether you have done a culture sensitivity test for the pus draining out of the sinus or not, because if you take antibiotics according to the culture then chances of recurrent sinus infection and fever are very less. Can you send me the photos of your infected area (preauricular sinus)? Mostly pus discharging sinuses are caused by tuberculosis infection in most of the cases. In my opinion, you should go for a detailed physical and systemic examination along with some blood tests and chest x-ray. Also, if discharging sinuses is still persisting then you need to do a pus culture sensitivity test both for bacterial culture and Acid fast bacilli (AFB) culture and other advanced tests for tuberculosis.

How accurate are ultrasounds in determinig the gestational age and conception?', 'Doctor': 'Hello,  Welcome to icliniq.com. The first-trimester ultrasound scans done before 12 weeks are the most accurate ones in the assessment of gestational age with an error of only + /- 5 to 7 days in the assessment of gestational age. So they are used for obstetric dating and determination of expected date of delivery. Moreover, if you have done 6 ultrasounds and the date calculated from each of them corroborates and does not lag behind then probably your baby is growing well and it is not small as you apprehend. The date we calculate from the first day of last periods is accurate only if the periods were regular for the last 3 months and there was no history of miscarriage or ovulatory disorder like PCOS (polycystic ovary syndrome) or contraceptive pill intake. In case of any discrepancy the date from dating scan at 6 weeks are accurate and to be considered. It is a probability that you actually conceived in later part of the cycle which leads to this discrepancy between the date and USG.

Cover the whole body while going out which will protect if she is allergic to sunlight. You can also go for skin allergy testing which will confirm the diagnosis.

Warts can have very varied morphology and most plausible explanation is for wart only. Because, considering it was a single lesion, was not painful or itchy, flesh colored and it persisted for a long time and resolved on its own. So all these factors favor it. Morphology can be variable. The negative factor was not sexually active. Although most common causes are sexual contacts, but significant number of individuals may have it with non-sexual contacts as well, it can be transmitted vertically during childbirth and remain dormant for a long time activating later in life. It can be transmitted with usual contacts and can be transmitted through clothing like underwear (if came in direct or indirect contact with infected individual clothing), sharing toilets, etc., can also transmit it. So being not sexually active is not a strong factor against it. Rest all causes like skin tags which would persist without treatment or fall off suddenly, PPP (pearly penile papules) would be numerous papules, other infectious causes would be short-lived and multiple lesions and symptomatic like painful tender or red. Malignancies are unlikely at this age and would progress. So the probability is high for wart only. I hope this helps.  ', 'Patient': 'Hello doctor, I am 24 years old. I have always been very anxious about health, especially my sexual health. But when I was about 9 or 10 a spot came up on my penis where the glans and shaft meet.

My mom took me to the doctor and they said like just come back if it gets bigger. She had likened it to a wart, but it was not very hard or dry. Anyway, it stayed for a couple of years after that it shrinks down. It no longer appears as if it is above the skin but appears as a small pin-sized bump underneath a skin bridge. I am curious if it cannot be an STD and I have never found anything similar online. So what could it be? I would not think a wart would stick around that long. And it really does not look like that at all. That was there over 12 years so I would not think it is anything fatal. To be even more specific, it is on the top side to the right. As I said, it looks like a skin bridge with a little bump underneath. But it really has no sort of texture.

There is nothing much specific help we could get drastically from diet modification for this condition.. Just maintain your ideal body weight.. But still you need to confirm it by a Biopsy.. Need not fear about biopsy.. As you described it is not removal of part of the lump.. It is just a pinch of the lump, a small bit from it with a small injection.. Sometimes your surgeon might decide to excise it as a whole and send for biopsy in which case, it is called Excision biopsy.. But that will serve you dually for diagnosis and also completion of treatment by total removal.. And it is only a minor surgery, not a major one.. So, just throw away your fears on that.. You can continue breastfeeding and plan for pregnancy. But I think, the lump may increase in size during pregnancy which I am not sure about..

But thing which make concerned, are-you have 3 endoscopies and all showling normal without signs of ulceration which is not usually a case in GERD patient unless they are on maximal acid suppressant medications and symptom free at the time of undergoing endoscopy. So endoscopy result has to be correlated with the timings and weather use of acid suppressant medication before making a diagnosis. Given some more interesting findings like dilated esophagus, and no ulceration at the time of endoscopy, with presence of persistent symptoms, suggest some other additional problem bystanding with GERD- such as motility disorder. Some time GERD is just a menifestation of motility disorders, because two disorders almost cause similar symptoms. Secondly for GERD, one must have PH-imepdence monitoring to confirm the diagnosis. And in case you have already gone through this, then you come in category of refractory GERD not responding to usual acid suppressant medications.

Intermittent fasting is wonderful lifestyle. What is your mode of intermittent fasting. Are you doing 16/8 or fast and feast? Have you tried 36 hours fasting? Please let me know. Also, low carbohydrates diet with no sugary juices and no added sugar is very beneficial. If the woman is not overweight or weight loss is ineffective then: taking into account potential adverse effects, ease and mode of use, the woman's BMI, and monitoring needed, Clomifene citrate or Metformin or a combination of the above. For women who are taking Clomifene citrate, I offer ultrasound monitoring during at least the first cycle of treatment to ensure that they are taking a dose that minimises the risk of multiple pregnancy. Women prescribed Metformin may know side effects such as nausea, vomiting and other gastrointestinal disturbances. If woman known to be resistant to Clomifene citrate, we can go for laparoscopic ovarian drilling or combined treatment with Clomifene citrate and Metformin if not already offered as first-line treatment or Gonadotrophins.

I feel depressed always with emotional instability. Please help to overcome it.', 'Doctor': 'Hi. The symptoms you have mentioned are symptoms of depression. You left home because of the behavior of your parents and then you are continuously feeling low because of ongoing things at office and at personal space. All these things are aggravating the depression in you. The feeling of worthlessness, emotional trauma, crying spells, emotional lability, anger outbursts, lack of interest in anything, etc are part of depression. But if these symptoms are persistent and are hampering your personal life and you have negative thoughts then yes, we can think that you have a depressive disorder. If the symptoms are not persistent then no need to get worried. You just have to change your lifestyle, try to not to expect anything from others. Just focus on your life and your things. If anyone hurts you then try to ignore the thoughts. This is difficult but in some days you will learn to suppress the thoughts and with the time you will be able to ignore any emotional trauma. No need to get worried. If you are not able to function properly then you can visit a psychiatrist in person and antidepressants can be started. Escitalopram is a good option in your case. The drug is safe and has great efficacy. This will help to make your mood better. Do you have any thoughts like killing or harming yourself? Any ongoing stress that is bothering you? Any relationship issue? PCOS (polycystic ovary syndrome) too is an independent factor that aggravated depression because of hormonal changes. Control of PCOS also helps in improving mood symptoms.

Now I stay away from family alone but seems like things will never change. I am all alone here and people I trusted have backfired on me. My office situation is very pathetic my manager harasses me emotionally or I do not know if I overreact. I just do not know what is wrong? I do not have any friends to talk. I gave a lot of importance to one person in my life and that person did not understand me at all. I cry all day in my room and do not even step outside. I get super angry or emotional on little things. I always stay alone in the office or at home.

This tube essentially ventilates both the ear and nose and in an event where this tube has got blocked, you might develop fullness and ringing sensation in the same ear. Self-cleaning your ear is the most dangerous thing you can ever do. Never introduce peroxide or any thing under doctor's advice as it can be disastrous considering the ear and it is related structures to be one the most sensitive regions in the body. Another possibility is that there could be some remnant wax in your ear which can be the reason for you developing this ringing sensation on a regular basis. You can consider using Soliwax ear drops three times a day for one week and then get the blob suctioned out by an ent specialist. Other than this, take tablet Sinarest (Acetaminophen, Chlorpheniramine, and pseudoephedrine) or its equivalent one tablet two times a day after food for the next 1 week.

My last period lasted only for few hours with a history of unprotected sex. Should I worry?', 'Doctor': \"Hello. I can understand your concern. According to your statement, you have been suffering from tenderness in your breast and little bit fatigue. Your last menstrual period was on 15th April which lasted for 15 hours and you had unprotected sexual intercourse on 4th. Usually, woman's menstrual cycle is 28 days (+/-7days) normally. So if period occurs seven days before the estimated date as well as seven days after the estimated date is quite normal. It may happen in every woman in her lifetime. It is nothing to be worried. Again menstrual bleeding can last for 2-7 days normally. So your last menstrual bleeding lasted for 15 hours which may be quite normal. You should not worry about that. You should know about the safe period during a normal menstrual cycle. It is also known as calendar method. In this period no woman becomes pregnant from unprotected sex. If your menstrual cycle is 28 days, then from the 9th day of your last menstrual cycle to the 16 th day of your last day of menstruation will be counted as danger period (from 9th day to 16th day, total 7 days are known as danger period). In this period a woman can bear pregnancy from unprotected sexual intercourse. The rest 21 days are counted as safe period. In this period no woman can become pregnant from unprotected sex. So, luckily 4th April was your safe day. So there is no chance for you to become pregnant. Hormonal fluctuations can cause breast tenderness. Breasts may become painful before three to five days of starting of a menstrual period and stop hurting after your period begins. Menstrual cycle causes hormone fluctuations in estrogen and progesterone which make your breasts swell and can lead to sore and discharge. Those hormonal imbalance may make you fatigue too. I hope this helps.  \", 'Patient': 'Hi doctor, I had my last period on 15th April which lasted only for 15 hours (the due date was 19th but it came four days early).

What can cause chronic throat irritation?', 'Doctor': 'Hello. We are happy to help you. From the details you have provided regarding your symptoms and the previous consultations, I can conclude with reasonable surety that you are suffering from a condition called reflux laryngitis. This is a chronic condition characterized by symptoms like chronic throat irritation, feeling of something stuck down the throat, frequent clearing of the throat and excessive throat mucous. It is because of local production of acid. Acid is produced in the stomach to aid in digestion. The throat mucosa is not suitable to handle the acid. When such local acid production occurs or the gastric acid contents rise up the esophagus, they cause chronic irritation of mucosa and produce these symptoms. They are seen typically as inflammation of the posterior larynx in endoscopy. If you can search for your endoscopy report and share with us it will be helpful. The treatment for this condition is to take a proton pump inhibitor like Rabeprazole 40 mg or Pantoprazole 40 mg twice daily, half an hour before food for about a month. Also, I advise to take a teaspoon of Mucaine gel (Aluminium hydroxide) after each meal and before bedtime at night for a week. The proton pump inhibitor prevents acid production and the gel which is a combination of antacid and local anesthetic produces relief of symptoms. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and take the medicine with consent. Some additional care to be taken during this treatment are, With these measures your condition will improve. But, it will be a gradual recovery. If you do not recover, then I would like to do some blood investigations to check if there is any other factor that is causing the throat issue. Also a repeat endoscopy can be advised to recheck the larynx, hypopharynx and cervical esophagus for the throat irritation.

I am in my 40s and I have had a few episodes of depression during my lifetime. I was lucky enough to be able to attend a psychiatrist in a country I lived in for a long time. It was a great help. My question at the moment is about medication. When I was quite depressed I took Cymbalta and another antidepressant which I am fairly certain was Wellbutrin. I dropped the secondary antidepressant after a year or so as I began to feel better. I am just considering using it again as I am now in a state of emotional upheaval due to a family death. I have just got in touch with a GP for an appointment in the next two weeks. What I would like to know is, it safe to take Cymbalta, Seroquel, and go back to Wellbutrin? How would I work the dosage? Would I start with 150 mg of Wellbutrin and possibly go up to 300 mg? When should I take the antidepressants? Can I take them both at the same time, or do I need to space them out? I am not prone to seizures and I have never had one. I am a female.'}, {'id': 1300, 'Description': 'Q. My brother is on Tagrisso and has persistent vomiting while eating grains. Please help.', 'Doctor': 'Hi,  Welcome to icliniq.com. In reply to your question for Osimertinib (Tagrisso), Osimertinib demonstrated improvement in PFS (18.9 versus 10.2 months, HR 0.46, 95% CI 0.37-0.57) and duration of response (17.2 versus 8.5 months) relative to other TKI. The PFS (progression-free survival) benefit was consistent across subgroups, including either patient with or without brain metastases. Response rates for Osimertinib is around 80 %. To put it to simple terms, the disease is controlled for more than 1.5 years with Osimertinib. Treatment with an EGFR TKI is generally continued until there is disease progression. If there is persistent vomiting, we need to do more tests to confirm whether it is leptomeningeal (LM) disease which is diagnosed in approximately 5 percent of patients with metastatic cancer. The most common solid tumors giving rise to LM are breast cancer (12 to 35 percent), lung cancer (10 to 26 percent), melanoma (5 to 25 percent). Headache is the most common initial symptom of LM, present in 30 to 50 percent of patients with symptoms of confusion, forgetfulness, disorientation, subtle personality changes, and/or lethargy collectively referred to as encephalopathy or altered mental status, are common in patients with LM. I would request to do Gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain and spine which often provides important evidence of LM. The definitive diagnostic finding for LM is the cytologic identification of malignant cells within the CSF (cerebrospinal fluid).  ', 'Patient': 'Hello doctor, My brother os recently on Tagrisso.

While a woman is breastfeeding post-delivery, menstrual cycles usually do not resume until 6-12 months, and it will vary from person to person. This is like a natural birth control devices by nature to prevent subsequent pregnancies at a shorter interval. But however, this is not 100% effective. The excessive bleeding that you experienced is definitely not normal even if you have resumed your cycles. One possibility is that you could have ovulated and got pregnant in the same cycle before you could get your actual periods, and it got miscarried (if you were not using any birth control methods). So I would advise to check your urine pregnancy test once if there is any history of sexual intercourse. The second possibility could be excessive bleeding due to other causes like fibroids or any other structural problems or hormonal disturbances which will have to be evaluated. Please get an ultrasound if possible to look for the same. Meanwhile, to control your excessive bleeding, I prescribe some medications which will help to control your flow. Please feel free to revert back with the urine pregnancy test results to rule out the possibility of pregnancy first. Urine pregnancy test. Ultrasound abdomen and pelvis.

My persistent heartburn has not healed even after taking medicines for more than 1 month. Why?', 'Doctor': 'Hello. You have briefly and well described your history, and I understand that you have very genuine concerns. So, the problem you have is called gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). This is basically reflux of acid from the stomach to food pipe causing heartburn, sore throat, sometimes cough, and shortness of breath. Our stomach produces approximately 1 liter of acidic juices to help digest food. The acid produced does not usually come into food pipe unless someone has loose sphincter at the lower end of our food pipe which prevents acid refluxing into the food pipe. There are two further classifications of GERD. PPI responsive GERD, and PPI refractory GERD. Your symptoms suggest that you have PPI (proton pump inhibitor) responsive GERD since your symptoms are significantly improved when you are taking PPI. Even in PPI responsive GERD the symptoms may not completely vanish but are declined to a reasonable level and this may be in your case. For this, you just need to increase the dose of PPI. Instead of once daily dose, you can start taking it twice a day before meals. The rest of your symptoms like sore throat will go away once your acid reflux is suppressed well. Diet may or may not affect the GERD. However, there are certain precautions that you can do to prevent heartburn. Avoiding large volume meals, instead, take small but frequent meals. Avoid taking large meals at night or before going to bed. Give at least three to four hours gap after night meals before going to bed for sleeping. Raise the head end of your bed by placing a cement or wooden block down the head side of your bed. Or there are commercially available anti-reflux mattresses that can be used instead. Avoid wearing tight-fitting clothes and belts. So your concern about the presence of symptoms despite 42 days of treatment is valid, but you see the acid is produced daily, and the medicines can decrease the acid production for the duration of time they are in the blood, once the level of the drug declines from a certain point, the acid production takes over back. So taking a daily pill to control your acid production is the only effective way of treating your condition. No long term use and side effects. Well, all PPI are relatively safe and do not cause significant side effects if taken for years and years. However, there are studies that have shown renal damage, bone protein loss, and aspiration pneumonia but in practice, these side effects are not that common as elaborated in studies. The one daily pill to control your acid and prevailing a normal lifestyle is much more important than unforeseen and often unestablished side effects from long term use of PPI. I would recommend if PPI helps you to do well then there is no reason for stopping for the sake of unforeseen complications. But if you still have a concern about the long use of PPI, then I would recommend you to get PH-impedance 24 hours testing to confirm GERD, and if present then PPI again is the therapy, but if the test comes out negative, then PPI can be stopped.I hope this helps. PPI responsive GERD. Ambulatory 24 hours PH-impedance testing. Non-erosive reflux disease. GERD. Tablet Pantoprazole 40 mg before breakfast. You can increase it to 40 mg BID before meals. Follow up if want to discuss more.  ', 'Patient': 'Hi doctor,  I have persistent heartburn related symptoms for the last four to five months. I visited a gastro and he prescribed me medicines for 14 days. My conditions got better but not fully cured, so I was given another 14 days of medicine (including a proton-pump inhibitor). Soon the lockdown kicked in and I went back to my home. I meanwhile took Ayurvedic medicines for a month here. While it has reduced the duration of heartburn episodes, the problem has not gone yet. For the last month, I have mild heartburn (pain in chest) for 20-60 minutes in a day (spread across three to four intervals). 14/30 days my throat felt different. 7/30 last days had acid refluxes.

Let me tell you a statement which explains it perfectly. The ear receives the sound but interpretation of sound happens at the brain. So many a times with mild hearing loss speech perception is low moreover you have tinnitus too. I hope you have fitted with digital programmable (computerized programmable) hearing aids. If yes, it amplifies exactly the same as required in each frequency. No need to worry about it. By the way avoid caffeinated drinks (tea, coffee, alcohol) and avoid noisy situations as much as possible. Puretone is used in the test in which you got the result mild mid-frequency hearing loss (pure tone audiometry). But in day to day life you are not listening to pure tones right? It is speech so pure tone audiometry and speech audiometry should be done and correlated, if that would have been done then you must have a clear picture of your problem. My honest suggestion is to use the hearing aids, so as not to worsen the condition. If you stop using it that may cause further deterioration.  ', 'Patient': 'Hello doctor, I am a man in my early twenties that started using hearing aids about a year ago. I am very happy with this, it has really changed my life. Just recently I started reading up a bit more and now I feel very confused and weird about it all. The thing is, I was told I had a mild mid-frequency hearing loss. When I actually look at my audiometry test it shows that as well, but my hearing is barely within the range of being considered a hearing loss. Reading around I found out that most people with such a mild loss can mostly hear fine and do not need hearing aids. When I read about what my hearing loss is supposed to be like, I do not relate. I relate way more to the explanations of what moderate hearing loss sounds and feel like. And hearing aids help me a lot. When I do not wear my hearing aids it sounds to me like listening to people talking through a door. I rely a lot on lip-reading if I cannot wear my hearing aids, phone conversations were almost impossible before I got them. I just cannot make my hearing loss make sense with my actual experience with hearing. So I have been wondering what causes me to feel like I hear so bad when my hearing is just slightly below the normal range? I should say that I have tinnitus as well, sometimes quite a lot, so that maybe factors into it too. Recently I began to wonder whether the reason I hear so much worse compared to other people with my level of hearing loss? Is that I have ADHD and PTSD which makes it so hard to focus? Do you think this is a possibility? Or could it simply be that I handle my hearing loss worse than others? I just do not understand why I experience hearing speech as so difficult and why I am so dependent on hearing aids when my hearing loss is technically very mild?'}, {'id': 1313, 'Description': 'Q.

I got swollen and painful lump in my armpit post influenza vaccination. Why?', 'Doctor': 'Hi. I understand your concern. You are having lymph node swelling axillary post influenza vaccination. Influenza vaccine is a very safe vaccine. Although some may have local pain, swelling, and fever. Some may have local lymphadenopathy. Lymphadenopathy is a swelling of lymph node (normal gland present in our body, which function as clearing harmful substances and providing immunity). Local and systemic reactions mostly began between day 1 and day 2. When a lymph node rapidly increases in size, its capsule stretches and causes pain. Pain is usually the result of an inflammatory process. It is a reactive response of the lymph node to the vaccination. So no need to worry. It can be managed by simple Paracetamol or anti-inflammatory medication such as Serratiopeptidase. It should resolve within a week. If it is associated with fever or any other site enlargement of lymph node you can visit your physician. I hope this helps. Reactive lymphadenitis. CBC (complete blood count), ESR (erythrocyte sedimentation rate), USG (ultrasound) axillary lymph node. Lymphadenopathy. anti-inflammatory Paracetamol 500 mg twice or thrice daily or Aceclofenac, Paracetamol, and Serratiopeptidase combination tablet twice daily for three days. Follow up after three days.  ', 'Patient': 'Hello doctor, I got the influenza vaccination about a week ago and have a swollen and painful lump in my armpit.'}, {'id': 1326, 'Description': 'Q. Will I get any relief at all from this constant heartburn and all the other symptoms?', 'Doctor': 'Hello. I welcome you to icliniq. I can understand that must very much frustrated for your ongoing non resolving symptoms. I want you to understand why this symptoms of heartburn occurs in reality. Hear burn is a common symptoms, that can occur in normal subjects as well but does remain long. In some people heart burn occur secondary to acid reflux in food pipe (esophagus)- which usually settles with one dose acid suppressant medication or twice daily capsule. However, there is a third group of individuals where by the maximum does acid suppressant does not effect very much-as in your case. We call this condition as refractory Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). So why I started emphasizing on all this, because management is different. The work up of refractory GERD start with an endoscopy-a procedure where by a gastroenterologist puts a tube with camera in to your esophagus and see what is inside. Also there are other battery of test which could confirm what is exactly a problem- may be straightforward i..e. reflux, but it can be some thing which is mimicking GERD. The GERD mimickers are many. The one of most common are esophageal motility disorders-which are another set of disorders in itself. So to cut the story short, I want you to first of all optimize the acid suppressant treatment. I know you taking omeprazole 40 mg twice daily, but it is important you take these medication 30 minutes or sometime 45 min. before meal. It is very important, since at times it is timing which is important than the drug itself. But, if you are doing it already in that manner, I would recommend you to think about endoscopy now. But it would help us to determine some other more information not necessarily the acid reflux. Keep taking gaviscon, but increase the dose. Take 15 to 20 ml at one time, 4 to 5 times daily and half hour after meals. The rest of your symptoms such as feeling lump in throat is common if someone has reflux. It is called as globus sensation. Dont worry about that. It will go away once your acid controlled adequately. The stress and anxiety sometime create a vicious cycles, where the disorder is perpetuated and influenced by it. But I think this is not the only explanation of your problem. The stress is obvious thing in one with non resolving symptoms. For example if do not reach to a particular diagnosis by endoscopy, I would consider testing for esophageal motility disorders, and some more allergic and hyperalgesic problems of esophagus. But for now, let the above treatment plan work. Meanwhile get some blood test done as advised below. I hope this would be helpful for you Let me know if you need any future consultations.

A month back, I had a faint heartburn throughout the day, and woke up in the middle of the night with severe heartburn all over my chest . Mid week it was so bad that it went in my throat and everything. I went to the hospital and was immediately prescribed ranitidine 150mg for 14days. As it came to week 2, I got only worse, with no sleep whatsoever, lump in my throat, extreme fatigue where my leg was involuntarily fluttering and my lip was voluntarily twitching. By third week I started omeprazole 40mg with the ranitidine and the heartburn intensity reduced but I experienced lots of other symptoms like bloatedness, stomach making noises all the time, nausea, breathlessness was the main one, heart palpitations which were never ending and this constant pressure on my nose and head. I’m now in week 5 and unfortunately the heartburn is still very much there, it comes and goes. The lump in My throat has improved from the second week but it still feels very heavy, I can almost press it and feel something clicking. Doc has said to double my dose of omeprazole so to take 80mg plus ranitidine. Will I get any relief at all from this constant heartburn and all the other symptoms? Am I in some sort of serious trouble? I’ve lost quite a bit of weight, I’m on bland food, elevated at night and all the lot but yet my quality of life is so heavily impacted as I can’t do anything throughout the day because of the constant palpitations, heartburn or pressure in my nose and head or the bloatedness and nausea.

I totally understand this is a long duration, but we need the medication for controlling your future symptoms.

This is an irregular fast heartbeat that occurs in bouts after eating and during resting and spontaneously revert back. What did your ECG show?

D-dimer is usually elevated in some thrombotic events in the body like DIC (disseminated intravascular coagulation), deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism.

The other causes for elevated D-dimer can be liver disease, heart disease, inflammation, post-surgery, and pregnancy as well. Your heart is normal as per history, so heart disease can be excluded. You can rule out the liver disease by SGPT (serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase), SGOT (serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase), and serum protein estimation. If you have pregnancy or surgery history than it can be the cause.

Please check your blood glucose levels and HbA1c level to see for your glycemic control. Also, I am assuming you are taking folic acid supplements because that is a vitamin that helps prevent certain birth defects (neural tube defects - in other words brain and spine defects) in the baby.

In your case, it is likely possible as you have a history of ear trauma while cleaning your ear. Simply taking anti-inflammatory medication and antibiotics will help.

Lastly, migraines can present in a various manner. As your having chronic headache it is also a possibility. It is important to find out the specific cause, so it can be treated appropriately.

Should I be concerned about fertility and pregnancy complications due to bicornuate uterus?', 'Doctor': 'Hi Thanks for your query woman may never need treatment for a bicornuate uterus. If it is required, the surgery is known as a Strassman metroplasty. This surgery may be recommended if a woman has repeated miscarriages and bicornuate uterus is thought to be the cause. Performing this procedure, as a solution to infertility, is controversial, as the majority of research carried out suggests that having a bicornuate uterus will not affect a woman’s chances of falling pregnant. Some evidence suggests that problems, such as miscarriage and early birth, are more likely in women with the condition, though it does not rule out a successful pregnancy and natural delivery. Women with a bicornuate uterus who do become pregnant should have additional monitoring and checkups throughout their pregnancy, to minimize risk and identify any problems early on. It’s not necessary that all those with this condition will get problems with fertility or pregnancy but the chances are more especially if it’s septate uterus where there’s full septum diving uterus into two. Sometimes it can’t be established on imaging and laparoscopic view may be necessary.  ', 'Patient': \"Results from an HSG procedure showed that I have a bicornuate uterus or a thick septum. Both Fallopian tubes are patent. But there is an abnormal position of the uterine body, possibly due to a cystic nodularity in the right adnexa, displacing the entire uterine body toward the left side of the pelvic cavity.   Currently trying to conceive and I'm pretty concerned about the complications with both fertility and pregnancy due to the potential above diagnosis.   Further clinical evaluation is recommended. What can be done to fix this and/or make the changes for a healthy full-term pregnancy?   Thanks!\"}, {'id': 1374, 'Description': 'Q. I get recurrent ear pain whenever I clean my ears with q-tips?', 'Doctor': \"Hi. I know how frustrating this problem can get. You can follow the advice mentioned below. 1. Please stop using earbuds q-tips as they introduce infections into a sensitive region such as the ear. 2. If there is pus coming out of your ear, there is a possibility of you developing an ear infection that may or may not involve the eardrum. 3. Take tablet Amoxicillin 500 mg with Potassium Clavulanate 125 mg combination one tablet thrice times a day after food for one week. Along with this, you can also take a combination of Paracetamol, Phenylephrine, and Levocetirizine one tablet twice daily for one week. 4. Keep your ears closed with sterile cotton and change it every six hours. 5. Do not allow any water or air to enter into your ear as it can keep getting infected and pus or ear discharge will start once again. 6. In a case where if by chance there is perforation of the eardrum, it will close on its own once the discharge subsides. Do not worry about it, you will be completely fine in a week's time.

I have sinusitis for the past 6 months and no medication helped me. Why?', 'Doctor': 'Hi. Yes, I understand how frustrating your problem can be. Sinusitis is usually secondary to a certain problem such as allergy (which is the most common cause, once other rare causes are ruled out). So considering the treatment of this particular issue, we need to always treat the primary from its root source so that the effect remains for a longer time with the least amount of medications. What can be done? If you are having underlying allergic issues such as sneezing, watery nasal discharge, ear fullness, heaviness in the head, and facial regions, we need to treat the allergy first. You need to wear an n95 mask (and nothing else other than that) to prevent any irritative substance such as dust, fumes from entering your nose, and initiating the allergic cascade mechanism leading to its symptoms. Wearing a mask even at home, avoiding exposure to dust and other substances which instigate sneezing according to me is the single most important factor which you have to take care of as other things mentioned below are all for symptomatic relief and we are not treating the allergy as such, precisely speaking. Take tablet Sinarest (Acetaminophen, Chlorpheniramine, and Pseudoephedrine) one tablet two times a day after food for 10 days, Allegra-M (Fexofenadine and Montelukast) one tablet two twice for 10 days, Duonase nasal spray two puffs in both nostrils twice daily for three continuous months (do not inhale while applying the spray), tablet Mucomix 600 mg one tablet twice daily for 10 days. Do steam inhalation two or three times a day for supportive relief. Take Wysolone 10 mg once a day after breakfast for 10 days, tablet Pan D (Pantoprazole) one tablet before breakfast for 10days, Clarithromycin 500 mg twice daily for one month. Saltwater gargles 8 to 10 times a day will keep irritative substances away from the throat. All these medications will be useful only if you strictly follow the precautionary measures. The requirement of medications will automatically reduce once your symptoms come down with a decreased allergic load. Please do get a noncontrast CT (computed tomography) of the nose and paranasal sinuses and show it to me once you get it done in the subsequent follow-ups. I advise you for a follow up after two weeks of treatment, so I can evaluate and let you know about the further requirement of medications. I hope this helps.

Is CRTD good for heart patient with acute heart failure and MI?', 'Doctor': 'Hi. As he had a heart attack, first priority is revascularization of angioplasty or bypass surgery. If this is done and heart function improves, then it will be good. In right bundle branch block, there is very little benefit of CRT (cardiac resynchronization therapy). If revascularization is not possible, then maximum medical therapy is best. Yes, ICD (implantable cadioverter defibrillator) is indicated. It should be considered once the patient is out of the acute episode and is stabilized. If the patient needs recurrent hospitalization for heart failure or recurrent BP drops that need medicines to raise it, then the option is left ventricular assist device (LVAD) or total artificial heart (TAH) or heart transplantation (subject to availability of facilities). First thing is to assess for revascularization if there is viable heart muscle. I hope this helps.  ', 'Patient': 'Hi doctor,  My father has acute heart failure and extensive MI since two months ago.

BP will be fine. Measures to control BP (blood pressure): 1. Avoid smoking and other addictions. 2. Reduce salt intake in diet. 3. Reduce fatty foods, junk foods, and saturated fats. 4. Avoid stress and anxiety. 5. Do regular moderate intensity exercise such as brisk walk for 30 minutes. 6. Have proper night sleep, at least eight hours a day including at least six hours in the night (uninterrupted sleep). 7. Reduce weight even if weight is within the normal range. 8. Drink plenty of water. 9. Do deep breathing exercises and meditation. Measure BP while you are totally relaxed, sit for five minutes in a quiet room without talking to anyone. Empty bowel and bladder before checking BP. Avoid tea, coffee 30 minutes before checking BP. Sit on the chair with feet on the ground, back supported, hand supported on a table, cuff at the position of heart. Check the BP and repeat it after five minutes again. Then check the BP in the other arm and repeat it after 5 minutes. During the entire period remain relax and quiet. Arm with higher BP readings is your exact blood pressure. You may take at least two or more readings and the average of readings is your actual BP. If these measures do not help then switch medicines. But before switching, have renal function tests and electrolytes done. If the tests are normal, and you are not allergic to components of the following medicines, then take tablet Amlodipine or Valsartan 10/160 mg in the morning or evening time. Measure BP daily as described above for two to three weeks. If it normalizes, continue the medicine, if not reconsult.  ', 'Patient': 'Hello doctor, My father is 65 years old.

Can schizophrenia be inherited and pass down to next generation?', 'Doctor': 'Hello. Based on the history provided, I see that you do not have any first degree relatives with schizophrenia. So the risk is not high. This condition can run in families, but the risk is more when you have first degree relatives with schizophrenia (like parents, siblings). Schizophrenia is relatively rare affecting about 1% of the general population. So anyone in the world has a 1 in 100 chance of developing schizophrenia. Your risk will be the same as the general population ( ~1%), possibly marginally higher due to extended family history. You need not worry unnecessarily as the risk is not substantially higher than anybody else in the world. To give you an idea about the genetic risk of schizophrenia, look at these figures. If there is a first degree relative with schizophrenia, the risk increases to 10 %. If both parents have schizophrenia, the risk increases to 50 %. If there is identical twin, the risk can increase to about 50 to 65%. You do not fall into these categories. You may be aware that genes play a role in the etiology of schizophrenia but they alone are not responsible. Schizophrenia is caused by a complex interaction between genes, environment, and psychological factors. Environmental factors like illicit drug use and high stress levels play a huge role. Since there is a possible history of schizophrenia in the extended family, it makes sense to avoid any risk factors like illicit drugs use (weed, cocaine, etc). Continue an active and healthy lifestyle. Continue appropriate treatment for depression, anxiety, and OCD (obsessive-compulsive disorder). If you have any other concerns, you can contact your psychiatrist for a review. I hope this helps.  ', 'Patient': \"Hello doctor, I am a 28-year-old male in good health.

According to your statement your grandmother have been suffering from purple spots on leg and arm with osteoporosis. When small blood vessels are ruptured causing blood to pool under the skin and can create purple spots on the skin are known as purpura. Purpura may be resulted from illnesses such as bleeding disorder, recent history of blood transfusion, cancer, SLE (systemic lupus erythematosus), infections like HIV (human immunodeficiency virus), hepatitis C, CMV (cytomegalovirus), EBV (Epstein Barr virus), etc. It may also occur due to inflammation of blood vessels, blood stream infection, vitamin C deficiencies, medications like Heparin, Aspirin, Sulphonamide, steroid, chemotherapy, Digoxin, Hormone replacement therapy, etc. Purpura are usually benign and may resulted from above mentioned causes and it sizes can vary from small dots to large patches. Senile purpura is benign which affects older people as their skin and underlying blood vessels become more fragile with aging and may bleed from minor trauma. The treatment depends on causes and most of the purpura does not need any treatment and dissolved over time. It may take 4 to 6 weeks to heal.

I took Clavulin for frontal sinusitis, but still, feel pressure on top of my head. Why?', 'Doctor': \"Hi! Apologies for the late reply! As you have rightly put it, the most probable problem out there is a severe allergic problem with an associated sinusitis (frontal sinusitis to be precise). I have tried to explain things in a very simple yet precise manner below. The cascade of events is explained in a very simple manner below eventhough its not as simple as it looks!  Exposure to dust (or any irritative substance that your body is hyper sensitive to) will initially initiate reflexes such as sneezing to remove the offending agent out but if this fails, mucosal cells in you nose start to hyperfunction producing loads of mucus to trap dust(owing to its sticky nature), this mucus has no where to go other than either being blown out of due to mucociliary activity gets pushed into the throat, thereby entering into a new zone, the throat initially reacts by activating cough impulses to push out the mucus, but if that fails, a local inflammation around the throat starts which often leads to symptoms such as feeling of a lump in the throat and repeated feeling to clear the throat.  Now this is general cascade that usually occurs in most people, but need not be specific to you.  Sinusitis is always secondary to something, allergy being the most common out of them. There could be other reasons as well for sinusitis to occur such as a hypoplastic frontal sinus, narrow frontal outflow tract/ frontal recess/ sinonasal polyposis etc.  Another important fact About sinusitis is about its recurrence. Plain use of antibiotics doesn't solve the issue, but just keeps it off for a while. We need to dig down and see what has caused the sinusitis in the first place for appropriate treatment rather than superficially treating it with plain antibiotics.  Precautionary measures is one such thing which if followed ( such as in a case or allergy) will definetly go a very long way in keeping the problem at bay. The requirement of medications also will be less and on the whole you will have immense benefit.  You can consider the following advice All precautionary measures have to be followed strictly for maximum relief, other wise medications won't be useful on long term. If things don't seem OK even after following the treatment schedule mentioned above, a non contrast CT is mandatory to find out what exactly could be going on in the sinonasal region. Anatomical variations, extent of inflammatory load are few things we look into while reading a ct scan. Surgery can be considered (if above medications and precautionary measures don't give any relief), but there is a catch to it. The symptoms might come back sometimes even on a higher scale after a brief relief following surgery if the precautionary measures post surgery are not followed. Ideally speaking in a nut shell, I again emphasis on preventing any irritative substance from entering the nose and throat, thereby triggering an allergic cascade of events and reproducing the symptoms you have mentioned above. I hope I have answered to your query in detail. Sorry again for the late reply. Get well soon!

However, it may cause trouble if gas trapped excessively and result in belly swelling. The reason behind this excessive bloating in your case may be aerophagia (engulfing air while taking meals that commonly occur in one who keeps speaking while having bolus) can be due to supragastric belching and may be due to excessive gas production after meals. The last group of people in medical science are termed as bloater, some are early bloaters where bloating occurs within 15 minutes of meal and some are late bloaters where bloating occurs after two hours of meal. This whole explanation is just to make you understand your own condition well. You seem to be late bloater and cause seems to be excessive gas production plus aerophagia.

You only need to take 10 tablets and your period will start about two to seven days after taking the last tablet. It varies from person to person. Deviry will not interfere with ovulation and since you get regular cycles you can expect to ovulate any time between 12 to 16th day. I am sharing a little extra detail that will help you.

I have gone through the attached images (attachment removed to protect patient identity), and it is true that there is some black discoloration at the glans penis (penis head) but it does not look like symptom of any illness or disease.

In case there is no improvement after improving personal hygiene I recommend you to post high-resolution images on the follow-up query.

This generally represents injury to the penis because of some injury due to aggressive masturbation which may be applicable in your case. So it is important to remain gentle with yourself when you hold your penis next time.

Please confirm if she has lost all her upper primary teeth or lowers where the permanent teeth have come? Other thing is if all the upper four primary incisors are gone and three have come. Generally, we need to see which tooth incisor has not come out of four permanent incisors. If missing tooth is lateral incisor means next to two central incisors then we can wait and watch for another two to three months. Other scenario is if only one upper incisor is lost three to four months ago and the rest of the milk (primary incisors are intact) then we can still wait two to three more months. But if out of four upper permanent incisors, only one that too central permanent incisor has not come out, then it is better to take radiograph IOPA (intraoral periapical radiograph) x-ray first to rule out any hindrance in the eruption of the tooth or any permanent missing tooth. If possible click and share the picture of mouth (oral cavity) with teeth and send it across. Generally, a delay of one year in an eruption of permanent teeth is quite normal.

As you have rightly put it, there is a possibility of recurrent fungal infection what we call as otomycosis. This condition is very notorious for its recurrence even after treatment. Usually, usage of earbuds i.e. q-tip initiate the entire problem as often the cotton tip is not sterilized in a proper manner thereby introducing infection. The entire fungal blob can obstruct your ear canal, and you will have fullness along with itching and associated pain. It is very essential that the fungal blob be suctioned out completely not leaving backtraces of fungal hyphae as they can form another colony in no time. I recommend you to see an ENT to get this entire blob suctioned out. Continue to use the antifungal ear drops (I usually recommended a combination containing Clotrimazole as it is the most effective in treating such conditions).

What damage could it caused?', 'Doctor': 'Hi. You might have developed an eardrum hole i.e. perforation since the eardrum is a very delicate structure and cannot tolerate a high volume and high impact gush of air. In such a circumstance, you will definitely have symptoms such as ringing sensations, feeling of air coming out, irritation, unable to tolerate loud sounds, and even decreased hearing. There is nothing to worry as the eardrum heals on its own in four to six weeks provided you follow certain precautionary measures. Precautionary measures include not allowing water to enter the ear. Place sterile cotton in the outer ear and wear a shower cap as well while having a head bath. Cotton places have to be changed every six hours during the day. There is no medication as such required unless your ear has got infected and there is discharge. In such a situation, the healing process might take even more time or sometimes if adequate care and hygiene are not maintained, the hole or perforation might not heal at all and might require surgery to get it closed.

I can understand your concern. According to your statement, you have been suffering from severe chills that you needed to wear thick warm clothes at home without AC or fan in summer now. Chills are the sensation of feeling cold. Chills are caused by rapid muscle contraction and relaxation. They are the body's way of producing heat when it feels cold. They often occur alongside a fever which is when the person's temperature is higher than normal. However, a person can also experience chills without a fever like you and there can be many different reasons for this. Possible causes include hypothyroidism is when a person's thyroid gland does not produce enough hormone that regulates their metabolism. Some people like you are more sensitive to the cold and may feel chills more frequently. Any type of viral or bacterial infection sometimes produces chills before a person gets a fever. Chill is a classic symptom of Malaria. It can have three stages. 1. Cold stage where a person experience chills. 2. Hot stage where they have a high temperature. 3. Sweating stage. Anemia may develop due to poor diet, age, chronic illness, medications, gynecological diseases, etc. Most common symptoms include waking up tired, looking pale, and always feeling cold with chills. Hypothermia can be resulted from dropping body temperature below the normal range due to any causes. Hypothermia can be dangerous especially when your body temperature falls further. If the temperature falls below 96 degrees you should seek medical care immediately. So you should monitor the body temperature with a thermometer during chills. You can do some investigations like CBC (complete blood count) with PBF (peripheral blood film), thyroid function test (T3, T4, TSH), RBS (random blood sugar), etc. Treatment depends on causes. So we should find out the exact causes of your suffering and then treat them accordingly. I want to add that dehydration, anxiety, panic attacks may cause chills too. When your body does not have enough fluids it is hard to maintain regular body temperature and this can lead to hyperthermia and fever like symptoms including chills. Again anxiety is more often associated with feeling sweaty than feeling cold but sometimes it can cause a chilly feel as well. And if you have panic attacks you might experience full body chills according to the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH). In order to cope up with your chills, you can do the following • Drink lots of fluids including oral rehydration saline and plenty of rest. • Sponge with lukewarm water. • Don't bundle up in blankets or use AC or high speed fans. • Enjoy a warm soup and drink warm beverages. • Use a humidifier. Please inform the results after undergoing the investigations.  \", 'Patient': 'Hi doctor, I am a 23-year-old female.

Your stomach contains contents that are acidic in nature and is only meant for the stomach, if these content reflux or have a reverse entry into your food pipe (esophagus) or throat which is not meant to handle this acidic pH. This can lead to a chronic inflammation leading to chronic ulcers giving a feeling of something stuck on the throat or the bloaty feeling, repeated belching, or even bad odor in your breath. Yes, esophageal diverticula (outpouchings are a differential diagnosis and have to be checked with contrast barium swallow). The probability of having these outpouchings are less considering as you do not have vomiting or difficulty in swallowing. Please follow some instructions: 1. Maintain a strict diet schedule, and eat on time. 2. Avoid oily, spicy, and cold food items/ beverages. 3. Keep a minimum gap of two hours between your last meal and going to bed. 4. Try to sleep in the left lateral position. 5. Eat frequently but in little quantities, never over eat. 6. Salt water gargles at least 8 to 10 times a day for one month. 7. Keep sipping on warm fluids as much as possible. 8. Avoid exposure to dust by wearing an n95 mask. You can consider the following treatment.

You can take Azoran as 1.5-2.5 mg per kg body weight. Plus the dose of Mesacol is also low. Increase the dose to at least 2.4 gm/day and you can go up to 4.8 gm/day maximum. Regarding frequency of steroid dosing, you can take it up to twice per year, in case of flare of your disease, but it will be better to avoid it if you have a better option (Azoran) because steroid has many long term adverse effects. Metabolite level of Azathioprine. Complete blood count. ESR (erythrocyte sedimentation rate). Steroid dependant ulcerative colitis. Tablet Mesacol (Mesalazine) 800 mg thrice a day.

Abnormal uterine bleeding is the most common side effect of Depo-Provera therapy, especially in the early months of use. It is a problem whenever bleeding continues for more than 14 days, is heavy, or symptoms such as pelvic pain accompany it. Bleeding irregularities that typically occur may include breakthrough bleeding (you are having this), spotting between periods, prolonged periods lighter or heavier periods than normal, lack of period (usually after one year). Some women with 8-10 days of bleeding over two weeks are administered tablet Ethinyl estradiol for 10 days and bleeding generally stops in five days. Other physicians prescribe an estrogen patch. If estrogen is contraindicated, patients are given 800 mg of Ibuprofen three times a day for five days. In all cases of heavy bleeding apparently related to Depo-Provera use, other causes (e.g., cervical malignancy, uterine fibroids, sexually transmitted diseases) should be ruled out before treatment. Depo-Provera acceptors can anticipate irregular bleeding as long as for one year and learn to accept it. If not too severe, this is the most effective management strategy. I hope this helps.

Why?', 'Doctor': 'Hello,  Welcome to icliniq.com. I can understand your concern. According to your statement, you have been suffering from shortness of breath, chest tightness without any cough, and cold. Shortness of breath, chest tightness can result from some conditions which are mentioned below. Anxiety is a common condition associated with chest tightness, shortness of breath, rapid heart rate, sweating, nausea, etc. GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease) occurs when stomach acid travels back up from the stomach to the esophagus and associated with chest tightness, shortness of breath, difficulty swallowing, etc. Muscle strain typically occurs from intense activities like reaching or lifting when twisting related with the same clinical features. Costochondritis is the inflammation of the cartilage in the rib and associated with the same type of features. Even PUD (peptic ulcer disease), valvular heart diseases, pulmonary HTN (hypertension), esophageal rupture, pericarditis, hiatus hernia, etc can cause chest tightness with shortness of breath. Treatment depends on the causes. So you should undergo ETT (exercise tolerance testing), echo, endoscopy of upper GIT (gastrointestinal tract), barium swallow test, CBC (complete blood count), etc for detection of underlying causes which are responsible for your sufferings. You should also undergo FEV1 (forced expiratory volume), ABG (arterial blood gas) analysis, spirometry for pulmonary function test, reversibility test, etc for the diagnosis of bronchial asthma as your pulmonologist has diagnosed earlier according to your prescription.

My nose is stuffy, and I have headaches. Is it a chronic sinus infection?', 'Doctor': \"Hi, Looks like your having a chronic allergic problem out there. Now there are certain things which have to be understood in detail. 1. Allergic rhinitis is an immune complex issue which is innately present and starts showing symptoms at one particular age. It basically is a hyper responsiveness to something which is foreign and has accidentally entered into you nose causing cascade of chemical events leading to nasal congestion, watery nasal discharge, sneezing, itching in eye and nose, fullness in the ear and often leads to sinusitis causing heaviness in the area of your face involving the frontal and maxillary regions besides your nose. 2. Antibiotics has a limited role here unless it's an infection that we are are treating 3. You have to wear a n95 mask and not allow the triggering factor to enter into your nose in the first place (trigerring factors range from dust, pollens, animal fur, fumes, strong odours etc and the list is endless), allowing the triggering problem to keep entering your nose is just going to prolong the problem through life and no medication will ever be effective 4. Nasal steroid sprays have definelty a role to play, I usually suggest a combination of a topical steroid such as fluticasone propionate along with a antihistamine such as azelastine hydrochloride 2 puffs in each nostril 2 times a day 12 hrs apart for 3 months straight 5. Certain antiallergics containing fexofenadien 120mg one tab two times a day 12hrs apart for 20 days is effective. Antibiotics like clarithromycin 500 mg twice a day if taken have to used for 2 long months to be extremely effective(I give clarithromycin for both its antibiotic and immunomodulatory activity, later of which is more important) 6. Salt water gargles 8 to 10 times a day for 10 days, sipping on warm water, steam inhalations avoiding cold, spicy and oily junk food goes a long way, smoking and alcohol to be completely avoided as it slows down the mucociliary activity and leads to secretions inisde your nose causing a severe sinusitis and its related problems.

Also if you may have prexisting GERD or gastroduodenal ulcer , gastritis. These may also cause nausea vomiting postoperative. So I would advice discuss issues with your anaesthesiologist and surgeon. Nausea, vomiting can be taken care of by medicines like proton pump inhibitors, H2antihistaminics, antiemetics which will be give by your physician in recommended doses.

The area of the strain between your ribs may be painful to touch. Again this pain can radiate to shoulders or sometimes side sleeping can cause damage to the rotator cuff and create a lot of pressure in this group of tendons and eventually produce pain.

And the resting pulse rate between 50 to 90 is appropriate for you. So, readings anywhere in between are fine. Also, BP fluctuations nowadays are more commonly seen due to the use of electronic BP apparatus, which are over-sensitive and cause variations. If you are using an electronic BP apparatus, then you should take three readings at a time with arm resting on the table and completely relaxed. And two matching readings are approximate BP of yours. However, if most of the BP readings are above or below this range then needs dose change, so let me know the details of your readings.

Results showed UTI (epithelial cells 20-25/HPF and pus cells 30-35) and TSH (13.5) raised as well as Candida Albicans growth from a throat swab.

Urine culture was done and it was normal. My query is, whether this is a bad infection, not bacterial but growth of esophageal candidiasis can be treated by antifungal therapy Fluconazole? No improvements are seen with many antibiotics. Oral thrush candida was found on initial appointments and also candida in throat swab. Is there any harm in trying a course of Fluconazole?

What is the possibility of potential ectopic pregnancy while on contraceptive pills?', 'Doctor': 'Hello. You have to know that contraceptive pills will prevent a future pregnancy if you have taken the pills for seven days. After that, you can have unprotected sexual intercourse. So before that you have to use another form of contraception. Also, if you have had sexual intercourse not in your ovulatory day (that means at first day of your cycle), the possibility of a pregnancy is low. The urinary test has a high acurracy, if you perform that after a week of menstrual delay. I read that you have experienced a rupture ectopic pregnancy last year. The typical symptoms of an ectopic pregnancy are missed period, abdominal pain, cramps, and spotting. I recommend you a b-HCG (human chorionic gonadotropin) blood test. You can repeat that every 48 hours to detect a future pregnancy. It will double its value in an intrauterine pregnancy, meanwhile, the rise of b-HCG value in an ectopic pregnancy has another pattern less than a normal pregnancy. Also, the COC and the medication that you take can affect your cycle. I would recommend b-HCG blood test at first. If you have the bleeding within your expected date without delay, it would be your cycle that has come.

This is what it felt like last year before I took a test, just way less severe. I looked online and learned that I can take a pregnancy test at least 19 days after intercourse, so I just took one, and it came back negative.

It dripped a lot and covered the majority of the toilet paper. The stool itself was not red, just light brown and regular as always. I do not think I have any external cuts or wounds because I do not feel any pain or stinging sensation as I wipe. If it were an external wound, it would have healed by now. I have been wiping gently or dabbing to stop the bleeding. Although I feel fine (no external or internal pain), I am anxious and nervous about this development. My rectum does bulge out when I pass stools, so the obvious is hemorrhoids. But the bleeding seems like something from inside.'}, {'id': 1587, 'Description': 'Q. Is it normal to have irregular period, ovarian pain and brown spots with Depo shots?', 'Doctor': 'Hello. As you mentioned, it is a known side effect of Depo shot to have irregular spotting or occasional bleeding too. And usually, the effect of the Depo Provera shot last maximum up to three months only (depending on the dose). The present experience of heavy bleeding and cramps may not be related to your Depo shots, it may be due to some underlying cause. So, I would like to know why was Depo shot advised for you? Was it only for contraception (birth control) or was it for any complaints like excessive bleeding and cramps during your periods (which may indicate a process called endometriosis)? Irregular bleeding may indicate some underlying hormonal disturbances which need to be evaluated. I would also like to know if you have any recent weight gain, excess unwanted facial hair, acne problems, scalp hair loss, headaches, visual disturbances, etc.? These may give some clue in finding a reason for this irregular pattern of bleeding. Also, if possible you could share some reports of your previous investigations like ultrasound to help me in guiding you for further evaluation.

My last shot was administered sometime befor three months (I do not remember the date). I had taken two shots but decided to stop because I kept bleeding and spotting while on the shot.

I am 4 months pregnant with hyperthyroidism. Is PTU good for me during pregnancy?', 'Doctor': \"Hi. Hyperthyroidism in pregnancy is usually treated with Propylthiouracil 50-100 mg/day. Generally, treatment is withdrawn four weeks prior to delivery after which normal doses may be resumed. Your hormone levels are still very high, you need to increase your dose. Pregnancies complicated by uncontrolled hyperthyroidism may result in higher incidences of spontaneous abortion (miscarriage), preterm labor, low birth-weight babies, or stillbirths. Complications of pregnancy, including pre-eclampsia (a condition associated with hypertension, low blood platelet count, protein in the urine, and mental changes) may also occur. So please increase your dosage. Another thing I want to highlight is that you should do TSH (thyroid-stimulating hormone) receptor antibodies and to see what is the cause of your hyperthyroidism. Is it Graves’ disease. These antibodies can enter from the mother's blood to the baby's blood and stimulate the baby's thyroid gland. These antibodies should be measured in the mother during her second trimester of pregnancy because the values that are greater than five times normal have been associated with hyperthyroidism in the baby at birth.  \", 'Patient': 'Hello doctor, I am 26 years old.

Depression and anxiety are very common and a lot of people have it. It basically happens when some neurotransmitters such as serotonin reduce in your brain leading to a problem with handling the day to day stresses of life. Medicines are usually given for two to four months and then tapered off slowly and stopped. Things like St Johns wort, Eltroxin, etc., will only add to the effect of the primary antidepressant. It will never be a substitute for the medicines. Still, if you wish to try these, you can take St Johns wort twice a day, and also take L-Theanine 200 mg once or twice a day. L-Theanine is also an over the counter dietary supplement which shows good results for anxiety. If you have sleeping issues, you can take Melatonin 5 mg over the counter supplement at night.

Please help.', 'Doctor': 'Hello,  Welcome to icliniq.com. I understand that you know very well about your disorder as of now. The basic problem with the IBS-D (irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea) is the spastic contraction of bowel and increased secretion of various gut hormones leading to abdominal pain and diarrhea. Since you have tried many medications so far, I see there is still a role of low dose antidepressant medication which help normalize the gut hormones in balance. But unfortunately, these drugs have some side effects, not necessarily mental wise but some physical adverse effects such as dry mouth, dry eyes, and can sometimes lead to constipation and also could cause increased sleep. But since we recommend the patient to start with a low dose and then gradually step up if tolerated well. You can take tablet Amitryptline 5 to 10 mg once daily at night time. And your mind will take sometime before actual improvement. Like it can give you relief in two to four weeks time. Try it for four weeks and come back to me to discuss if we need to increase the dose or add some add on medication. Uncontrollable IBS D. Follow up after 4 weeks.

My tracheostomized sister needs frequent suctioning due to breathing difficulty. Is it an emergency?', 'Doctor': 'Hi! If the patient is tracheostomised and if your really SURE that the secretions from the tracheostomy tube is saliva, then there is a possibilty of developing a fistula(an abnormal connection) between the food pipe(Oesophagus) and the trachea called as tracheosophageal fistula. In such a condition we first need to heal the fistula and it can be done by following below mentioned advice 1. There would be a cuff inflator pipe through which air can be inflated and deflated in and out from the cuff. Even though the inflated cuff prevents faulty aspiration of fluids from the mouth while swallowing, it can also create a necrosis around the trachea thus causing the oesophagus to get connected to it. You to need to suction the tube and deflate the cuff every 2 hrs for 15mins so that this raw surface connecting the two heals and saliva from the tube stops coming. 2. For few days, the patient might be stopped orally and a ryles tube might have to be inserted to feed the patient. Repeated swallowing can again infect the area and might lead to leak of food also through the tube. ( you can go to the emergency of any hospital to get this tube inserted in case its not there!)

My father lose his conscious when he holds back his sneeze. What to do?', 'Doctor': 'Hi. First, we need to find out what is the cause of recurrent sneezing. If you look into the physiology, sneeze is a protective reflex often in response to something irritative and offensive which the body wants to push out in order to prevent it from reaching the lungs and thereby into the circulation. Most commonly it is dust, but can be attributed to other irritative substances such as animal fur, pollens, smoke, fumes, etc. What can be done? 1. Prevention of entry of irritative substances is the key and plays a major role in preventing allergic responses. This can be effectively done by wearing an n95 mask most times even while indoors. 2. In addition, a combination of antihistaminic and steroidal spray containing Azelastine and Fluticasone two puffs two times a day does wonder. 3. Holding a sneeze inside can be lethal, as it is high pressure reflux and by holding the sneeze, reverse pressure can be created which has no where else to go but above to the cranium thereby an increase in intracranial pressure causing a vessel to rupture resulting in a stroke. This is a far possibility, but in elderly individuals, it can happen and is lethal. Secondly, an increase in intrathoracic pressure can also stimulate the vagus nerve resulting in vasovagal syncope causing a brief loss of consciousness. It is very important that these measures are followed in order to prevent any untoward incident. I hope this helps.  ', 'Patient': 'Hello doctor, My father is 54 years old.

Why do I get frequent nose bleed?', 'Doctor': 'Hi. I hope you are doing well. I understand your concern. I assure you that you need not be worried. Epistaxis or nasal bleeding is a very common condition and has been reported to occur in up to 60 percent of the general population. Most nosebleeds are not serious and can be handled easily as you have mentioned. Most will stop on their own or with simple first aid actions. Common causes of epistaxis are local causes such as chronic sinusitis, nose picking, foreign bodies, intranasal neoplasm or polyps, irritants (e.g., cigarette smoke), medications (e.g., topical corticosteroids), rhinitis, septal deviation, etc. If the nose bleed is related to an injury, you should be assisted in finding medical assistance urgently. Some people may be taking medications that make them more prone to bleeding. These people should also seek care urgently. Signs and symptoms include bleeding from one or both nostrils, bleeding in the back of the throat, causing the victim to vomit blood. First Aid Interventions: Sit upright and lean forward. Spit out blood that collects in the back of the throat or mouth. Pinch the nose firmly. Use your thumb and index finger to pinch your nostrils shut. Breathe through your mouth. Continue to pinch for 5 to 10 minutes. Local drops such as Oxymetazoline or Phenylephrine solution can be helpful. To prevent re-bleeding, do not pick or blow your nose and do not bend down for several hours after the bleeding episode. During this time remember to keep your head higher than the level of your heart. I hope this helps.  ', 'Patient': 'Hello doctor, I am a 27-year-old female.

Well to begin with, why was septoplasty performed in the first place? Did the similar symptoms exist before you underwent the surgery? If you did, then there is only one possibility left for the problems that you r having right now, that is undercorrection or incomplete surgery. Considering that there is absolutely no allergic issues whatsoever and there are no other associated nasal issues that we could be seeing here. Antibiotics and nasal steroid sprays are not going to bring much benefit either and should be taken for a long term. On the other hand, what you could possibly do is to lay down with your head upwards facing the ceiling rather than taking a posture which can aggravate the obstruction. You should be meeting the operating surgeon to see what could be the reason for the current problem, because he/she is the best person to answer that question.

I am losing 15-20 strands of hair daily with thinning and dandruff problem. Please help.', 'Doctor': 'Hi. Hair fall can mainly be divided into two types, you can have increased shedding or thinning of hair. Increased shedding means seeing more than 50-100 hairs falling per day. Less than that is a normal hair fall cycle and usually grows back. Increased shedding can happen because of dietary deficiencies, stress, high fever, water change, harsh shampoos, dandruff. Since you are noticing patches of emptiness most likely it is thinning or male pattern baldness. This can happen due to genetics and male hormone testosterone acting on the roots. Smoking, thyroid issues, and consuming whey protein can accelerate it. By genetics, it need not necessarily mean your father or mother, it could be uncles or grandparents as well. Minoxidil is the treatment of choice for patterned balding. Also, checking up for deficiencies like serum ferritin, vitamin D, and B12 and TSH (thyroid-stimulating hormone) will help. Photographs are needed to exactly identify if you are having patterned balding and accordingly treatment can be started.  ', 'Patient': 'Hello doctor, I am a 21-year-old male.

I would give you some treatment but I want that you should be examined in person by a local general surgeon, if any need of surgical removal of this. Otherwise at moment take following treatment.  1. Ispagol Husk 2 tsp/ daily with water irrespective of if you have soft stools or hard stools. Fibre has to do with many other things in your gut besides just stool softening effect.  2. Tablet Ciprofloaxcin 500 mg twice daily for 5 days.  3. Tablet Flagyl 400 mg thrice daily for 5 days (can cause some gut upset and mettalic taste in mouth but fairly low side effect profile).  4. Sitz bath. Put approximately 5 ml of dettol or any antiseptic and put in bath tub filled almost half with tapid water and at least try it 3 times a day.  5. Keep your area clean near your bottom.  6. Remove hairs.  7. Reduce weight. Increasing weight would impair your defecation (stooling) mechanism and that would abnormally high presure over your bottom. This worsens anal fissure in long term.

If multiple, whether they could be felt discreetly or they are stuck together? Also, if you had any history of fever recently? That could have given some idea about the nature of these groin nodal swelling. The most common causes for the enlargement of the groin nodes is any infection or inflammation in the sites they drain the lymph fluid, which includes the genital area (including the lower third of vagina) and legs. So, I would like to know if there is any genital infection or ulcers, or any infection or wound in your legs.

My 9-month-old daughter is having frequent loose motions. How to control it?', 'Doctor': 'Hello Welcome to icliniq - Loose motion ( diarrhoea) is common problem in young kids. It is very important to make sure that your daughter is well hydrated till she gets better . - It is very good that you are already giving ORS solution which needs to be given frequently. Loose stools can last for some days before getting better. It will help to clear the body of germs & toxins. I need to ask you a few more questions to guide you in the right direction - How many times /day does she have loose stools ? - is there any blood in stool ? - is she is any pain ? does she cry while having stools ? - is there any vomiting ? - is there any fever ? if there is no fever , there is no need to give paracetamol. - any signs of dehydration ( lips & tongue dry, not passing urine as usual) - Is her weight gain good and within normal range ? - is she otherwise her usual self or is she ill looking, crying & confused ? Treatment plan: - Provide your daughter with frequent sips of ORS throughout the day. For every loose stool she needs to be given 10 mls/kg of ORS. Assuming her weight to be 7-8 kgs, you should give 80 mls ORS for every loose stool. ORS needs to be continued till loose stools stop -You can also give tender coconut water if available. - Give bland non-spicy food like plain idli, rice for some days. -If she is still breast feeding, it is good to continue. - If available you can give Enterogermina oral suspension 2 mini ampoules a day for 3 days. You can mix with water and give her. - Zinsy syrup 5 mls once a day for a week - Most common reason for loose stools at this age is viral , so antibiotics are not needed. But if she has fever or bloody mucusy stools she will need to be examined . Otherwise, loose motion will settle in 4-5 days IMPORTANT Due to the Coronavirus lock down, visiting hospital/clinic may be difficult. But if your daughter shows any of the following signs she needs to be taken to the nearest hospital/clinic to be examined by a paediatrician. - looks sick - not drinking ORS - lips and tongue getting dry - not passing urine even once in 6 hrs - looks dull and crying excessively - blood in stoll If you have any further concerns, you can contact us again for further advice Take care  ', 'Patient': 'Hi Doctor, Kid age 9 months. weight not sure.

As your complaints are left arm feels weaker, sometimes tingling in random fingers with morning neck and back stiffness, I feel it is compression at spinal cord root levels as that is even confirmed by MRI scan which you have already undergone. So my provisional diagnosis with view of your age, gender, height, and weight is cervical spondylotic radiculopathy which can best to be treated with physiotherapy and lifestyle modification.

Go for daily walking for about 1 hour, if not jog inside the house. Our primary goal should be to relieve compression and strengthen the muscles around the neck and shoulder. Chin tuck exercise is good only, in addition, you can do neck and shoulder girdle exercise also. You can lie on the belly and do the neck and shoulder elevation exercise. Pendulum exercise also will give you much relief. You lie flat on the floor or use a very thin pillow. As this lockdown finishes you need to take cervical traction and IFT (interferential therapy) at a physiotherapy center nearby. Take only warm water regularly.

Which medicine, according to you, is best for my psychological disorders?', 'Doctor': 'Hello. Thank you for your detailed query and history. With regards to your anxiety symptoms, you have tried out SSRI (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor) and SNRI (serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor) class of medications. So, I would like to suggest you try a TCA (tricyclic antidepressants) class of antidepressants like Amitriptyline 75-100 mg, Dosulepine 100 mg, or Nortriptyline 75-100 mg. They are indicated in people who have had partial results with SSRI or SNRI medications. If you do not wish to try out the TCA and coming back to your query about the three medicines, the best results for anxiety will be with Paroxetine between 12.5 mg to 37.5 mg, and Citalopram will also work fine at 20 mg. In addition to these, you can also consider augmenting the action of these by adding Mirtazapine 7.5 mg at night. I would like to suggest that you should consider reducing Olanzapine to 2.5 mg, since you are not in hypomania, and have depressive symptoms. Reduction to 2.5 mg will make it an augmenting agent again for the antidepressant, and also further help with your anxiety issues.

Your vitamin A level is marginal rather than low. Less than 0.7 or 0.5 is considered low and up to 1.05 is considered marginal. So, you will probably need supplements at a very low dose. Total intake of up to 10,000 units daily is unlikely to cause any harmful effects. So, supplements of 7500 units or even 10,000 units per day for a month or two would be enough for you. I guess you do not have any symptoms of vitamin D deficiency like xerophthalmia or visual difficulties where one would need higher doses. Also, for vitamin D, supplements like Calcirol sachet are recommended in dosing of 60,000 units once a week for eight weeks with milk, and following which you may have it once a month for the next six months.

I have hypothyroidism and Hashimoto's and feel fatigued after a year of treatment. Why?\", 'Doctor': 'Hi. Good day and thanks for your query. Some people treated for hypothyroidism may still experience symptoms even if blood tests show that their thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels are well within the normal range. The reasons for this are complex, but the bottom line is that having a normal TSH value does not necessarily mean that all of your symptoms will go away. Evidence suggests that situations like this are not as uncommon as one may think. Even when placed on Levothyroxine, the drug considered the gold standard of hypothyroid treatment, many people fail to reap the physical benefits of treatment. So, first, you can lower down your TSH target if you are still having symptoms. For that, we can increase your medication. If still symptomatic, the next choice is to change the brand of Thyroxine, and if still not feeling well, then think to go to T3 supplement rather than T4, that is Thyroxine. Thanks.

She will need a contrast CT angiography of abdominal vessels. However, the common iliac artery and femoral arteries are usually amenable to stenting, unless CT angiography shows diffuse disease (whole of the artery is involved with no normal segment) where stenting would be difficult. However, a disease involving these arteries is unlikely to cause generalized fatigue, but it can cause pain or weakness in the lower limbs while walking. Regarding the cause for fatigue, I guess the common causes like low hemoglobin, BP issues, any medications, deranged kidney function, low Vitamin D, deranged blood sugar are ruled out. One important cause that should be ruled out in her is the cardiac cause, because her CT scan shows mild fluid in bilateral lungs which may be related to heart and also with such extensive aortic disease, cardiac arteries are also expected to be involved. Cardiac disease may cause fatigue, shortness of breath on exertion. So, she should undergo ECG (electrocardiography), echo, and also CT angiography of heart vessels, if possible along with CT angiography of abdominal vessels. Also, some routine tests like hemogram, LFT (liver function test), RFT (renal function test), vitamin D, thyroid profile, sugar, lipid profile, ESR (erythrocyte sedimentation rate) and CRP (C-reactive protein) should also be performed if not done recently.

Can I consume cold foods with tonsillitis?', 'Doctor': \"Hi. If you are having a susceptibility for throat infections you need to understand why it is happening. Having cold drinks or fluids bring down the body's immunity by shade and that is why it can attract a viral or bacterial infection. It is not about whether the bacteria can survive in cold or not, but it is about whether your body's immune system is able to fight the infection to neutralize it before it spreads. Viral particles and bacteria are all there in the air that we breathe and usually the body fights back to protect from getting invaded by these organisms. Everyone has one particular level of immunity, some have a weak immune system while some have very strong immunity and can still bear eating junk food and drinking cold drinks all day and still not get an infection. It all depends from person to person. If your body is sensitive to cold things or anything for that matter, it is better to avoid such items to prevent you from acquiring an infection and taking unnecessary antibiotics and medications.

My grandfather has cough for about three weeks. Please suggest medication.', 'Doctor': 'Hi. It seems your grandfather is having a cough for three weeks. Cough in adults are classified as acute, subacute, or chronic based on the duration. Acute cough lasts up to three weeks, subacute cough lasts three to eight weeks, and chronic cough lasts longer than eight weeks. Subacute cough often has a post-infectious origin and will typically resolve without treatment. It is usually secondary to asthma or bacterial sinusitis. Reassurance is a good approach in otherwise healthy patients. Oral or inhaled corticosteroids, Ipratropium, or cough suppressants may be prescribed to help with sleep. The viral infection or bacterial infection mostly produce a fever and cough with expectoration. These symptoms you did not mention, I assume they are absent. Post viral cough can be last up to six weeks. I would like to ask about red flags symptoms such as weight loss, night sweats, and hemoptysis. If they are present you need further evaluation on an urgent basis. Other common causes of chronic cough (usually more than eight weeks) are allergic. Most often, chronic cough is due to postnasal drainage, asthma, and/or gastroesophageal disease. Some drugs such as ACE inhibitor (a type of anti-hypertensive medication) also results in chronic cough. Stopping such medication helps. Other remedies are steam inhalation alone or with menthol. Cough drops or lozenges soothe an irritated throat. Saltwater gargle. Honey is also helpful.

As you have described, it is a lymph node in your inguinal region. The human body has about 600 lymph nodes. Their role is to clean antigens from the extracellular fluid. It helps in fighting inflammation and infection. Lymphadenopathy (LAP) is the term to describe the conditions in which lymph nodes become abnormal in size, consistency, and number. A normal-sized lymph node is usually less than 1 cm in diameter. An inguinal lymph node size up to 1.5 cm should be considered normal. Lymphadenopathy can be called generalized when it affects two or more parts of the body. Enlarged lymph nodes associated with significant fever, night sweats, and unexplained weight loss (more than 10% in less than six months) are considered as red flags. It required an urgent evaluation for lymphoma. Those are not present in your case. Pain and tenderness on a lymph node is a non-specific finding. It is typically due to minor infection. Other causes of the inguinal lymph node are benign reactive lymphadenopathy, sexually transmitted disease, cellulitis or local infection, etc. Benign reactive inguinal lymphadenopathy is seen in patients who walk barefooted outdoors.

Due to cold, I get sound in my ears and jaw. What could it be?', 'Doctor': 'Hi. I understand your concern. Your symptoms suggest a condition called tinnitus. Tinnitus is defined as an auditory perception of internal origins such as a buzzing, ringing, or whistling tone and can be perceived as either pulsatile or non-pulsatile. It can have a significant influence on well-being and performance in daily activities. Your symptoms suggest it is pulsatile in nature. Identification of the underlying cause of pulsatile tinnitus is important for adequate treatment and for prognosis estimation. It can be due to cold and inner ear infection as you also have painful lymph nodes. But you did not mention a fever. If it is infection antibiotics dose will be helpful. Complete and detailed history is essential, which includes possible accompanying complaints like vertigo, hearing loss, ear discharge, and earache. We are worried about an underlying vascular etiology that can be suspected when pulsatile tinnitus is influenced by vascular compression or when a vascular bruit is heard by auscultation. In general, head and neck MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) and CT (computed tomography) provide complementary diagnostic imaging information. I suggest you consult an ENT specialist.

Welcome to icliniq. Although unvaccinated animals are more likely to transmit rabies, vaccinated animals can also do so if the vaccination of the biting animal was ineffective for any reason. A history of rabies vaccination in an animal is not always a guarantee that the biting animal is not rabid. Animal vaccine failures may occur because of improper administration or poor quality of the vaccine, poor health status of the animal, and the fact that one vaccine dose does not always provide long-lasting protection against rabies infection in dogs/cats. The scratch on your skin comes under category II for post exposure prophylaxis for which anti rabies vaccine is indicated . And although you have taken the vaccine 5 months before and your dog is also vaccinated there are very minimal chances of you or your dog having rabies but there is a very miniscule chance. But according to the guidelines you should get vaccinated again. Make sure to clean the area of scratch properly and thoroughly with soap and water. Observe your pet for the next 10 days and see if it’s health deteriorates which if does would be a strong indication to get vaccinated.

Post spinal headache: avoid using pillows, more liquids, and coffee will help. Some antiemetics can be added on. This is commonly seen in the first week after surgery. If you had a bad infected appendix, post-operative infected collections are common and this can cause your symptoms. But this will also cause fever and abdominal pain. Sometimes postoperative medications can cause small stomach ulcers and can cause these symptoms. You need to see your doctor and ask for antacids. Overall, if you are not having fever, loose stools, severe abdominal pain and vomiting and headache is not continuous, then nothing much to worry about.

Similar type of radiological findings can be found in post TB fibrosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease which includes two key components chronic bronchitis and emphysema, RA-ILD or IPF, etc. You may not tell your doctor about your previous history of Latent TB. For that reason his diagnosis was RA-ILD or IPF as you are suffering from RA. So he was not wrong as your radiological reports suggest the above mentioned differential diagnosis.

My sister has delayed growth for her 15 years of age. What should be done to improve her growth?', 'Doctor': \"Hi. Good day. Thanks for your query. I am afraid that I do not have good news for you. In your sister's age, it is not possible to increase height of about 2 or 3 inches with any medications. The growth plates in the bones close after 13 - 15 years of age in females and no increase in height possible. Growth plates are the areas of new bone growth in children and teens. They are made up of cartilage cartilage, a rubbery, and flexible material. For instance, the nose is made of cartilage. As kids grow, the growth plates harden into solid bone. A growth plate that has completely hardened into solid bone is a closed growth plate. After a growth plate closes, the bones are no longer growing. Growth plates usually close near the end of puberty. For girls, this usually is when they are around 13 - 15 years old and for boys, it is when they are about 15 - 17 years old. What is the height of your father and mother? Your sister may have an average height of both of them. Another option is limb lengthening surgery. Thanks.  \", 'Patient': 'Hi doctor, My sister is 15 years old. She is having a problem with growth. She is not growing even a single cm from 1 year. I am too scared about her future.

I recently consulted a specialist because the bunny tooth next to that tooth was losing the root and was hurting. They said we needed to stop my brace pressure as soon as possible. So, I asked my dentist if she could fix the tooth that is slightly behind the bunny tooth and the one beside it. After being persistent, she tweaked it a little to help it. Now the real issue I am having is, in image 2100 which is the image on the side showing my lip piercing, it shows that my teeth are good. However the image 2101, which is the side image without my lip piercing, my upper teeth and lower teeth are touching tip to tip. I also noticed that these particular teeth are slanted inwards towards my tongue rather than being straight like the rest of my teeth. The dentist told me that my teeth have worn from all the grinding that I do. However, when I check face front you can clearly see that the upper teeth are slanting inwards and I do remember when doing elastics, it was pulling them down from a lot of pressure. I believe this is a cross bite. The dentist would not admit it and saying there is nothing to be fixed. I have checked past photos before I had braces and from close inspection the cross bite area was never like that, in fact the upper teeth overlapped the bottom teeth and was fine in that area. I am wondering whether my dentist is correct that my teeth are fine and that it cannot be fixed? I am pretty sure if she put a button behind the tooth and then I did elastics, it not be fixed and brought forward and overlap the bottom teeth. My current medication is Doxycycline.

My husband's foreskin is stuck after he pulled it back while urinating. What can be done for the pain?\", 'Doctor': 'Hello, It looks like your husband is suffering from a condition called phimosis. Phimosis is a condition in which the foreskin is too tight to be pulled back over the head or glans of the penis. Now this can happen due to a number of reasons, and can be diagnosed only after examination. This usually happens when one does not clean under the foreskin, can lead to bacteria, fungus or other germs accumulating there. When this happens for some time, it can lead to balanitis inflammation of the glans, or the head, of the penis). Has this happened before? (Tight, shiny skin on the glans, redness around the glans, itchiness, or irritation of the glans, an unpleasant smell, tight foreskin that cannot be pulled back,etc.). When this happens it can lead to phimosis. After examination only I will be able to diagnose whether it is balanitis or phimosis and whether this is due to bacteria or fungus or some other cause. The treatment varies depending on the findings. Therefore, if the pain is severe, it would be best to take him to a urologist and get it examined. On the other hand, if the penis is red and swollen, you should take him to the emergency room. If you want, I can give you a cream for the pain, but if there is infection, there is a chance it will become worse.

I have severe heartburn with breathing difficulty, gas pain and burping. Why do I get this?', 'Doctor': \"Hello. I can understand your troubles regarding heart burn and difficulty breathing. You are having GERD (gastric esophageal reflux disease), and indigestion. Obesity, smoking, drugs, pregnancy. CBC (complete blood couont).  TSH (thyroid-stimulating hormones).  EGD (esophagogastroduodenoscopy). H.Pylori infection. GERD. Dyspepsia. Capsule Esomeperazole 40 mg 1-0-1 before 30 minutes of meal for 10 days then follow me. Syrup Gaviscon 20 ml after every meal. Maintain a healthy weight. Excess pounds put pressure on your abdomen, pushing up your stomach and causing acid to reflux into your esophagus. Stop smoking. Smoking decreases the lower esophageal sphincter's ability to function properly. Elevate the head of your bed. If you regularly experience heartburn while trying to sleep, place wood or cement blocks under the feet of your bed so that the head end is raised by 6 to 9 inches. If you cannot elevate your bed, you can insert a wedge between your mattress and box spring to elevate your body from the waist up. Raising your head with additional pillows is not effective. Do not lie down after a meal. Wait at least three hours after eating before lying down or going to bed. Eat food slowly and chew thoroughly. Put down your fork after every bite and pick it up again once you have chewed and swallowed that bite. Avoid foods and drinks that trigger reflux. Common triggers include fatty or fried foods, tomato sauce, alcohol, chocolate, mint, garlic, onion, and caffeine. Avoid tight-fitting clothing. Clothes that fit tightly around your waist put pressure on your abdomen and the lower esophageal sphincter. Follow after seven days.  \", 'Patient': 'Hello doctor, I have severe heartburn, difficulty in breathing, gas pain, and burping. Please suggest.'}, {'id': 1826, 'Description': 'Q.

Now, this could be due to a few reasons either allergy and repeated throat itch, infection, flu, and acid reflux. There also seems to be minimal post nasal drip. We of course can see the blood clot. It could be due to the removal of the stone and the area could have had mild bleeding which eventually formed the clot. Will you please provide us more details. Is there any allergy symptom runny nose, itch, watering of eyes, sneezing, breathing difficulty, etc? Do you smoke or drink? How many times are you gargling? How are your eating habits? Do you have a fever or weakness? I would suggest if it were just minimal allergy or flu to take an antihistaminic tablet, decongestant or saline nasal spray and a proton pump inhibitor. I would go with Zyrtec and Protonix for a few days. Zyrtec in the evenings and Protonix before breakfast for a week. Avoid spicy and oily diet. Desist from smoking and drinking temporarily.

Due to stress and thyroid issue, I get a lot of hair fall. Shall I use Rogaine foam?', 'Doctor': 'Hi. Hair loss occurs due to a variety of reasons. Most commonly at a young age is it occurs due to androgenetic alopecia, it is a type of alopecia due to the sensitivity of our frontal scalp hair to the androgens which increase during puberty. It appears at frontal areas and progressive gradually according to the genetic makeup of a person, in females it is in the central part of the forehead. Other type of alopecia occurs due to chronic illness, chronic stress, chronic drug treatment like chemotherapy and it commence three months after the inciting illness. So to treat it we have to rule out any disease in the body, stop any drug which may be causing their fall if possible. Avoid smoking, alcohol, and do mild exercise. Take a balanced diet and keep yourself stress-free. Medical treatment includes Minoxidil 5% twice daily over the scalp. Tablet Calcium pantothenate and Biotin preparation daily. Rogain also contains Minoxidil. Foam preparation better but costly. This treatment initially is continued for six weeks then we review the progress. In androgenetic alopecia, it has to be continued until you need hair to be normal because genetically those hairs have to be fall. With medical treatment, we are only stopping them. Associated disease or stress should be treated accordingly. Initially due to Minoxidil, there is increased hair fall because the hair which will be weak suddenly fall and strong and dense hair at the place grow which takes time and maximum improvement is seen after eight months of the treatment. Hair loss has multiple factors so try eliminating all in addition to testing your thyroid. I hope this helps.

Why do I shiver a lot during the day and losing weight?', 'Doctor': \"Hello, Sir, I am a family doctor from Icliniq and will try to answer your questions. It seems to me that you have two. The first concerns your use of Tylenol and Advil. You may not have meant to say overdose. If however, you have taken more than 800 mg of Ibuprofen or 1000 mg of Tylenol, those are excessive doses and could be associated with side effects. I would advise you to call the Canadian or US Poison Control Center. They give excellent free advice about overdoses. The second question is in regard to your fever and weight loss. I am not sure how long those things have been going on. With COVID-19 in your area, it is possible this could be your problem. There are many other causes of fever, such as influenza and various other viral and bacterial infections. Often when a fever falls, a person can feel chilled. Some things that you can do besides using Ibuprofen 400 mg up to three times a day or Tylenol 1000 mg three times a day include drinking alit of liquids getting rest and isolating your self from others. Things that would make you want to seek a doctor's care would be increasing cough, trouble breathing, chest pain, trouble thinking clearly or inability to care for yourself. I will pray that you feel better soon.

I plan on just letting it go away since there seems to be no other option. I’m concerned if the IUD will make the HPV worse? 3. At the same visit, I took a pap smear and results came back positive for BV-like flora. I went undiagnosed. Will my BV go away on its own? I don’t have symptoms like grey discharge or fishy odor so I’m not that worried. 4. The reason why I went to the OB last time was because I was itching like crazy down there. My discharge was like cottage cheese. It went away for a while but just just now, I checked for the string to my IUD and my finger came out with some cottage-cheese like substance.

Since you are already taking Urinorm, and if you have been regular in taking it, you should not have got the attack. In case you have been irregular in taking Urinorm or you have started it recently, it can be an acute attack. An acute attack is best treated by NSAIDs like Diclofenac along with Serratiopeptidase.

So first of all cylinderical change from -0.75 to -1.25 is not significant and most probably it was due to interobserver variation.

If you feel comfortable with glasses then you should wear otherwise this is very small error you will be able to do most of your tasks without glasses. thats upto you. yes, you can use lenses.

I have recurrent epistaxis with bruxism and ETD. Could it be due to sinusitis?', 'Doctor': 'Hello,  Welcome to icliniq.com.  You have recurrent epistaxis and you have been cauterized also a number of times. There does not seem to be any obvious pathology on examination by endoscopy. I must point out that epistaxis can be idiopathic in more than 50% patients. This is because certain patients tend to have nasal mucosa far more friable than others and susceptible to even most trivial trauma like nose picking or forceful blowing. Even minor colds can cause epistaxis. However, one has to be careful to rule out other causes. Hypertension is an important cause but that is usually an affliction of elderly. At your age, one would like to rule out bleeding diathesis. Did you ever have bleeding from any other site? Have you done a coagulation profile, though you have mentioned blood tests? What about liver and renal function tests? Are you on any medication other than this? Further deviated nasal septum with spurs can cause epistaxis. Did MRI mention anything like that? In case there is nothing to suggest any underlying cause, it is likely to be idiopathic. And role of precautions become all that necessary. One important thing is to prevent your nose from becoming dry as occurs in dry weather and colds. You can use liquid paraffin nasal drops to prevent mucosa from becoming dry and friable. Further you need to avoid blowing hard or frequent cleaning of nose. You can also use topical decongestants like Xylometazoline 0.02% if you develop a bleed. Avoid using them for more than seven days at stretch. You can go for a CT (computed tomography) nose and PNS (para nasal sinus) for having a better information on sinus details.

(attachment removed to protect patient identity). It is all normal. Usually, during the acute attack of gout, we do not start Allopurinol or uric acid decreasing medications as it can exaggerate the situation. We usually start after the acute situation is treated with drugs like NSAIDs (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs). Allopurinol is started with caution if there is liver disease, kidney disease, diabetes, congestive heart failure, and high blood pressure. Are you pregnant or breastfeeding? Are you receiving chemotherapy drugs? Allopurinol can decrease the number of blood cells in your body that causes blood clot and that help you fight infections, which can make it easier for you to bleed from an injury or get sick when exposed to others who are ill. It can increase liver enzymes to decrease the blood elements. But I have seen your blood works and it is fine. If someone has kidney stones due to increased uric acid, or recurrent gout episodes, or uric acid deposition on soft tissues that is the time usually Allopurinol is started and continued I think you do not have these problems. You need to decrease your protein intake like less meats, fish, lentils, eggs, and avoid diuretics which are used to treat high blood pressure. Alcohol intake to be reduced as well. You told your HBA1c (glycated hemoglobin) is 5.7 that is pre-diabetes or borderline diabetes, so better check your fasting sugar and sugar after two hours of eating. You need to do exercise even if it is just walking for one hour daily. Stop or reduce carbohydrates especially sugar in tea and sugary juices, bread, rice, pasta, and potatoes. Intermittent fasting can also help in decreasing weight and controlling sugar. Lifestyle modifications can help a lot in your case. Have you done any ultrasound abdomen?  ', 'Patient': 'Hi doctor, I would like to know what does my lab tells you about my current liver function. I began to struggle with daily gout pain a few months ago and finally gave in to taking the traditional drugs about one and a half months ago. Both allopurinol and probenecid caused worrisome impacts on my body. I began to experience flank pain, confused thinking, and fatigue. Around this time, I was also compelled to have my A1C checked because I was struggling with headaches, insomnia, and various degrees of itching after eating. My A1C turned out to be 5.7. I stopped taking the drugs, and did a lot of research, and was fortunate to find some supplements that seem to be effective at the intersection of both metabolic syndrome and gout. Presently, I have found that Berberine (approximately 1000mg/day) works. Gout pain is essentially gone, and blood sugar seems to be coming under control with each day, though my caloric intake in unsustainably low. Admittedly, I have taken some hesperidin, ALA, chromium, NAC, ECGC, nigella sativa oil, or triple strength turmeric occasioanally if I was having a momentary concern (not all at once), or even all in a day, but occasionally. My concern is for my ongoing liver function. Though things seem to be getting better, as the day goes on and I have taken some supplements, I will start to feel pressure in the middle of my back, kidney area, and left flank discomfort. It tends to have gone away by the time I wake up in the morning. On looking at my labs, the markers for liver function have fluctuated, but my primary care doctor never made mention of them. Is there anything you can tell me about what the changes in these ratios say?'}, {'id': 1856, 'Description': 'Q. I have alopecia in my beard. Will hair grow back in the patchy areas?', 'Doctor': \"Hello. I can understand your concern. According to your statement, you have alopecia on beard. It has been there for the last few months and you are on medication like Hydrocortisone for dermatitis. You may be suffered from alopecia areata which is a peculiar form of hair loss that usually affects the scalp but can occur on any hair-bearing skin like your beard. For most patients the condition resolves without treatment within a year but the hair loss is sometimes permanent. The cause of alopecia areata is probably an autoimmune reaction. This means the body's immune system incorrectly attacks the body's own cells. In case of alopecia areata, the cells under attack are in the hair follicles (structure that grow hair), especially follicles within hair-bearing skin. Alopecia Areata can be resulted from autoimmune disorders such as atopy, allergy, thyroiditis, vitiligo, etc. Even some studies show that stress, family history of alopecia, vitamin deficiency like Biotin, Vitamin A, C, D, E, etc., nutritional deficiency like iron, zinc, protein, etc., can also cause alopecia areata. For the treatment of alopecia areata, you can use Intralesional corticosteroid injections, topical Minoxidil, Anthralin cream or ointment, and topical corticosteroids. By using any of the above-mentioned medication and taking vitamin and nutrition that are mentioned above, you can get rid of alopecia areata within some months.  \", 'Patient': 'Hello doctor, I have noticed some alopecia on my beard.

Based on the description you mentioned, it appears that you have this condition called intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP), which can cause elevated liver enzymes or bilirubin along with itching. But however, it is important to rule out other causes of elevated liver enzymes (SGOT, SGPT, ALP) like hepatitis, HELLP syndrome (syndrome of hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelet count). Each condition can have different implications in pregnancy. Please check for your blood pressure records, platelets count, coagulation profile, viral markers (HBsAg, Anti HCV, HEV IgG and IgM). It would have been good if you could share the reports of your liver function tests and ultrasound abdomen (for liver) and also given details about any other symptoms you have faced like any stool or urine color changes, skin or eyes color changes, any fever, any raised blood pressure records, or any skin rashes (excluding that caused due to scratching because of itching).

I have a small palpable swelling under the right side of my jaw. Please help.', 'Doctor': \"Hi! You have assessed the condition in the best manner any patient could do! So considering the problem out there, like you have rightly put it , looks like we are dealing with an infected gland/ sialolith or a traumatised duct. In all three cases, I suggest you to follow the advice mentioned below 1. Hydration is the key, keep drinking 5 to 6 litres of boiled warm water every day whether your thirsty or not. 2. Salt water gargles @8 to 10 times a day for 1 month will definetly go a long way 3. You can consider antibiotic clindamycin 300 MG three times a day for 5 days. This antibiotic has the property of getting excreted majorly through the salive and majorly reaches the salivary glands a shade more than other antibiotics. 4. Please eat on time, spicy, oily and junk food have to be avoided at all times for the next one month. 5. An ultrasound of the glands is definitely mandatory to see if there is any Impacted stone, parenchymal issue etc, but to be done only once the pandemic subsides. (Considering that you shouldn't be going to hospital for risk of acquiring an infection) 6. This will take a while for it to subside, but chiefly depends on how much you happen to follow the above advice! Hope this helps, get well soon!  \", 'Patient': \"Ten days ago, I was eating some soup when some got under my tongue and I felt a sudden sour twang through the right side of my mouth and jaw. It gradually subsided in intensity and I examined the inside of my mouth for any tender areas or asymmetries under my tongue. There was a very slight swelling of my submandibular duct on the right side, but no tenderness or anything strange palpable. Later that night, I was eating some chips when I noticed rapidly increasing discomfort in my right jaw, earache, and pain when swallowing. I felt my throat and discovered a golfball-sized swelling under my right jaw. On the advice of my father (who said it sounded like a blocked salivary gland, and said he recently had one as well), I used warm salt rinses and external warm compresses. Within a short period of time, the swelling reduced by about half, and with repeated rinses, gradually reduced over the next day until it was minimal.  Since then, I have still had a palpable asymmetry when feeling both sides of my jaw, and my submandibular gland has not returned to its ordinary size. Last night, I felt discomfort in that area and realized on examination that it was beginning to swell again. I quickly used more salt rinses and a compress, and the swelling stopped, but it remains a bit more enlarged than it has been over the past few days. This morning, it seems to be fluctuating slightly in size, but I hit it with more salt rinses and compresses and it appears to be stable for now, though with a slight referred earache.  The submandibular duct has not seemed particularly swollen since shortly after the first day of symptoms, when I noticed a small white spot forming at the head of the duct, which disappeared shortly after using salt rinses. I infer that this may have been a very small salivary stone pushing its way out. I have been eating and drinking somewhat infrequently for the past few weeks due to a major housing disruption that has only recently been resolved, so it's my hope that, due to a combination of dehydration and infrequent stimulation of the salivary glands, I may simply have developed some small salivary stones that could resolve on their own if I am diligent with salt rinses and compresses.  At no point have I had any sort of fever or foul taste in the mouth, nor any symptoms in any other salivary gland besides my right submandibular gland. I also recall eating some hard, sharp food 10-11 days ago that had cut my gums here and there through miscalculated bites, so it also seems possible that I traumatized the duct at that time, although it's strange to me that swelling would be recurring now after relative reduction of symptoms for over a week (though as I noted, the gland has never fully returned to a non-palpable size even at its best).  I suppose it must sound like I've self-assessed the situation reasonably well, but due to the recent resurgence of symptoms (which I confess may be due to getting lax with salt rinses or proper hydration), I just wanted to seek some qualified medical advice as to whether I'm doing the right things so far, and at what point I should seek treatment if it doesn't completely subside. The only local ENT is not available by referral for 6-10 months, so my only alternative would be to go to the ER for assessment or attempt to find a general practitioner in the area (we just moved here, so we had to leave our old GP behind). Both options are bad for exposure, given the current pandemic, and my wife is a very high risk individual, so I'm doing my best to limit exposure unless I can't help it.

I have read your query and understand your concern. Social anxiety disorder is really a disturbing condition, but can be controlled with proper medicines and behavior therapy. Anxiety disorders occur in episodes and sometimes follow waxing and waning course. You had anxiety before 25 years of age and the anxiety relapsed since last one year. The feelings that people are judging you, ideas that what others will think or say, self-consciousness are typical symptoms of social anxiety. Feelings that you are good for nothing and unproductive are due to co-morbid depressive symptoms of social anxiety. Do you have anxiety during a presentation or in group discussions? Do you feel shy or stutter while talking to some person of big stature or any problems in talking to females? In severe social anxiety such type of anxiety situations is also seen. Medicines especially selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are drugs of choice for social anxiety. I suggest you to use Escitalopram drug. The drug is started with 5 mg dose for about 10 days and then can be increased to 10 mg. The drug should be taken in the morning after meals and should be used for about three to four months. After four to six weeks the dose can be reduced gradually. I suggest you to use Propranolol for anxiety provoking situations. The drug can be taken about half to one hour before some situations like presentations or group discussions. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and take the medicine with their consent. These medicines will definitely help in improvement. Breathing exercise and relaxation exercises will help you to control anxiety. Apart from this relaxation exercise, behavior therapy also helps in reducing the symptoms.

The reason for a chronic ear infection can be due to two reasons. 1. There is an abnormal permanent defect in your eardrum (such a hole which has not closed up due to the normal healing process) leading to recurrent ear infection and discharge. In some cases, superadded fungal infection might also be present causing itching and pain. 2. A dysfunction in your eustachian tubes which basically equalize pressure between your nose and your ear. In both scenarios, you will feel blocked ears, ringing sensations, heaviness, and decreased hearing would certainly be there. Follow these steps: 1. You have to maintain adequate ear hygiene not allowing any foreign substances such as outside air or water to enter into the ear and thereby creating a recurrent infection. 2. Do not use q tips as they worsen the existing problem by introducing more disease since the q tips are often not sterilized. 3. Get your self examined by an ent specialist to see what exactly is happening in your ear and the probable cause of the problem. I hope this helps.

I read your query with keen interest and understand your concerns. First of all, I must assure you that there is no evidence of disease called schizophrenia in your case. Schizophrenia is often presented with different kind of prodromal symptoms and they do not match to your current symptoms. Having said this, the symptoms are more indicative of anxiety disorder with added obsessive and compulsive behavior. This is more likely as you are already suffering with hypochondriasis, which is again a disorder from same spectrum of psychiatric disorders like obsessive compulsive disorder. I also like to inform you that stress, anxiety and depression can present with symptoms mentioned in the query and there is no doubt about that. For your clarification worsening of symptoms and spontaneous remission of symptoms are indicative of obsession rather than psychosis such as schizophrenia.

I am going to trace back the pigmentation for you and maybe you can help me out.Before three years, I applied Noritate and Ziana to my face. My skin in general was fine.\\xa0I had only one area of pigmentation on my face, right side of face 1 inch x 1 inch. As that was noticeable I asked a dermatologist if there was anything that I could do to lighten it. She gave me Tri-Luma. I decided to put the Tri-Luma on the affected area and also a few freckles on my upper cheeks. The next day I became extremely red and out of fear of triggering my rosacea I dropped Tri-Luma immediately. Then after a month, I stopped taking Ziana, because I moved back to a colder climate and my face was getting too dry.After some eight months, the area of pigmentation (right side of cheek) was started getting darker. So, I decided to give another try for Tri-Luma. I again applied it to the larger area of pigmentation and to the tiny freckles on my upper cheeks. The decision to apply it to the freckles was purely a cosmetic decision. The next day those freckles turned into full blown pigmentation. I immediately stopped the Tri-Luma and the pigmentation in those areas has basically been there up to present day. At that time, a local dermatologist had suggested me to apply some cortisone cream to the areas to lighten them up. The pigmentation subsided very minimally. I did not apply the cortisone cream thereafter.\\xa0The pigmentation from this point waxed and waned in intensity up until two months back. Then, it has remained prominent. There were a few times during this two year span where my perioral dermatitis flared up and I was told to restart Ziana, which also made the pigmentation worse. I was unsure whether the Ziana was bringing the pigmentation to the surface or whether it was in fact making it worse. I went to two dermatologists who had differing views of stop Ziana and keep using Ziana. I decided to stop as it appeared to be getting noticeably worse. Again, I do not know if this was a whole process of bringing the pigmentation to the surface or not. Please share your thoughts.'}, {'id': 1902, 'Description': 'Q.

He even chastised me for taking a CT scan telling me about the radiation effect of the scan and effect on kidneys of the contrast liquid.

What further helps you to restore your gut bacterial composition is to opt for natural selection. Like food changes, you have to avoid junk and bakery products as much as possible, Take alot of yoghurt (natural probiotic) and fruits. Increase use of vegetables. Avoid alcohol if you are taking. Continue exercise or at lease try to remain active. Collectively, this will change the story, you will feel better, but definitely process is slow and it will take time. So you have to exercise patience. I hope you will find it super helpful, give your feedback, let us know after a week, how you feel. If we could do further for you, we will definitely do but it depends how you take the things from here. Humble regards  ', 'Patient': \"I've been having stomach issues for almost 4 years now, when I was put on two rounds of back-to-back antibiotics for a bad tooth abscess. I was put on Augmentin and then Clindamycin, along with the use of Motrin and Tylenol as directed by my dentist. Since then, I have had stomach issues including: going to the bathroom more often, feeling pressure when having to go to the bathroom, occasional mucus in stool, and more recently, bouts of nausea, bloating/cramping, and very smelly gas. I have had various blood panels, tried probiotics (including VSL), rifaximin, diet changes, and I'm currently on Viberzi, which helped but made me a bit constipated/tired/bloated, so I lowered the dosage to 1 pill (100mg) per day instead of 2, which decreased side effects but also decreased effectiveness of the drug. Also, it seems my metabolism has shifted after the antibiotics and I gained weight faster than I ever have, and I am still struggling to keep my weight down after making significant diet and lifestyle changes. Any insight here into the weight gain and then anything else I could try for the stomach symptoms? Thank you!\"}, {'id': 1927, 'Description': 'Q.

I have been this weight since I was around 13 years old, my weight has always been around 40kg I was wondering how I could gain weight in a healthy manner. The main reason why I do not eat a lot is that I am not hungry so on some days I eat one meal in a full day, however, there are some days where I will eat 3 meals including snacks, however even on those days, even if I feel as if I have had a lot of food, my weight remains the same. I am concerned as I have realised that I am well below my average age group in terms of weight and I am not sure what to do, also I am not sure how much I should eat in a day because when I ask people around me I realise they eat less than me but maintain a healthy weight so I am really unsure how to approach my problem. Thank you'}, {'id': 1929, 'Description': 'Q. How likely is IVF successful during menopause?', 'Doctor': 'Hi. The best age for a lady to get pregnant is 19-35 years. The principle behind this is, every day your eggs are growing and out of the cohort of eggs, the best egg is selected, and remaining growing eggs go for atrophy. So by 35 years most of the good eggs are gone. After that age too, you have the chance of pregnancy, but lesser than the age of 35 years. After 40 years of age, the chance of pregnancy further reduce. As the age of lady increases the eggs left behind are not as healthy as the previous month. So even if you get pregnant, the baby is at risk of developing anomalies. But if your period has stopped, then you need to know if there are any eggs in ovaries. You can have any of the birth control pills (packet of 21 pills) twice daily for 10 days. No matter what the cause is, you will have periods within 7-10 days. On day 3 or 4 of the period do serum FSH (follicle-stimulating hormone) and AMH (anti-mullerian hormone). FSH >7 Miu/ml and AMH < 1.1 ng/ ml means egg count is below normal. The only option for pregnancy is IVF using donor eggs. This can definitely be the best option to get pregnant. I hope this helps.  ', 'Patient': 'Hello doctor, I am 46 years old.

What is the chance of getting pregnant at the age of 40 after endometriosis surgery?', 'Doctor': \"Hello. I understand it has been a year since your endometriosis surgery. I am not clear if you have taken any treatment following that to enable conception. From the limited information, you have given me and assuming that your partner's parameters are normal (as you have not mentioned anything about it), I will try to make my suggestions. As age advances, the maternal ovarian reserve comes down, which means the number of eggs a female has come down. Endometriosis is a disease that not only affects the ovaries but later causes adhesions, which also hamper your chance for pregnancy. It is also notorious to recur. Putting all these together, the chances of a natural pregnancy comes down, though definitely not impossible. But the medical advice here and the ideal thing would be not to lose too much time and go in for ART procedures like IVF (in vitro fertilization). Because once the maternal ovarian reserve becomes too low, the chances of pregnancy in an IVF cycle also becomes less. So it would be ideal not to waste time and think of approaching any of the IVF centers. Also, I would like to add that this COVID time is not the right time to start an IVF treatment though.

First of all, allergic reactions to food are sudden and happen without any prior history. It is very common for people to develop allergies. Yes, it is common to have these kinds of food allergies. Some people have episodic allergies and they subside completely and for few people, it stays. No one can prevent an allergic episode in the future. It is your genetic system that has caused this. You should always keep anti-allergic tablets, steroid tablets, and always have a back up to get a steroid shot for allergies. Because sometimes these might range from basic skin rashes, itching and flushing to life-threatening spasms. Hence should always be careful. When you consume the above foods next time, keep observing for symptoms. I hope this helps.  ', 'Patient': 'Hi doctor, I am a 30-year-old male.

To answer this question, I was just wondering why you got HCG done in first place as you were asymptomatic? Neither of the drugs you are taking does not interfere with this test (b HCG).

I understand the problem you are facing, it is partly due to anxiety and partly due to nerve and muscle hyperactivity. Coming to your specific questions: Yes, fasciculations and weakness in ALS (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis) come together, actually, weakness comes first and fasciculations are generally unnoticed by patients, they are usually revealed upon asking or found by EMG (electromyography). EMG is reliable and diagnostic for ALS. Fasciculations without weakness ruled out ALS, eight months are a long duration for ALS, if it would have been ALS, it would have progressed to much extent. And ALS is painless, it is motor neuron disease, so the sensory system is perfectly normal. I would suggest you to try one tablet called Carnisure plus (contains Levocarnitin 500 mg and Methylcobalamin 1500 microgram).

Then of course, I Googled it and I see some scary diseases like ALS. I went to a neurologist who, after some questions and examination said that it was due to an anxiety issue. To be sure he sent me to an institute specializing in the detection of neuromuscular disease, a neurophysiologist did a clinical examination (strength, reflex) and an EMG, and no abnormalities was showed, it were before three months. A month later, as my twitching was still going on, I went to another neurophysiologist, he did another EMG and again everything was normal. My neurologist said that it is impossible its ALS because muscle twitching for nearly eight months without any weakness. And I started to have so tingling and buzzing sensation. Again my neurologist said that it is very common with an anxiety disorder like mine. I started to take pills and to see a therapist for one month. I have to say that twitching is way better when my anxiety is low but sometimes it came back strong. I am so worried about ALS. My questions are: is EMG test reliable?

This fistula is created by anastomosing the side of a brachial artery to the end of a basilic vein that has been transposed laterally and elevated superficially to make it amenable to dialysis cannulation. Other sites could be leg also. I advise you to discuss it with your doctor. The patient requires dialysis for sure or you can put a central line and replace it every 15 to 20 days. But AV fistula is the best option.  ', 'Patient': 'Hello doctor, This query is for my father in law aged. He is 58 years old and is diabetic and currently under medication for BP also. He has a history of two major heart attacks. In the last five years, he did not have any major heart issues. Recently due to extensive amount of medications taken for a long time, he started showing signs of high amount of creatinine (currently 6.9). We did a few dialyses. Now doctors have advised doing an AV fistula on his left hand. His left hand is partially amputated from a previous septic shock treatment about four years back. His right hand is fine but an AV fistula there might terribly limit his movements and self-care. We wanted a medical opinion about where the fistula can be placed or can it be near to chest area as an alternate option?'}, {'id': 1975, 'Description': 'Q. When will I get my actual period after withdrawal bleeding due to i-pill?', 'Doctor': 'Hello. I have gone through your details. Many times some people do experience some kind of disturbance in menstrual patterns after taking an i-pill. As you got your periods on 27th March which was a withdrawal bleed, ideally speaking you should have been getting it around 24-28th April as per your routine cycle length. And this also not your fertile period as your cycles were always regular. But I would still advise you to take an emergency contraceptive pill because the previous cycle was disrupted with high dose hormones contained in i-pill. And the present cycle we do not know when exactly you ovulated. So it is better to take a preventive method as precautions (although repeated emergency contraceptive pills are not advised). Please use a more consistent method of birth control in the future like condoms and oral contraceptive pills which give a wider window of safe period and also would not disturb the menstrual cycles like emergency contraceptive pills. I hope this helps.  ', 'Patient': 'Hello doctor, I took i-pill on 17th of last month and had a withdrawal bleeding on the 27th. When will I get my next period? I again had unprotected sex today.

Please help.', 'Doctor': 'Hi. First and foremost, I would advise you not to panic or get disheartened. According to me, there is no major issue out there and we usually encounter such issues very often in our outpatient department. Now looking at your case, oral ulcers can be due to various causes right from nutritional and vitamin deficiencies to infections or repeated trauma. Getting each and every parameter tested often becomes extremely expensive and might frustrate you even more. Coming to your second major concern, difficulty in swallowing with no major pain as such can be due to some ulcers down in your throat, or infection in your pharynx (throat), or constant gastric irritation. Advice: 1. Consider taking a good multivitamin for two to three months. 2. Follow a healthy, hygienic lifestyle. 3. Avoid smoking, alcohol, etc. 4. Avoid having spicy, oily, and junk food items. 5. Salt water gargles at least 8 to 10 times a day. You should keep your oral cavity free from contaminating organisms and hence the throat infection. 6. Keep sipping on boiled warm water. 7. Consider antireflux therapy if you have the slightest of reflux issues. 8. Get your viral markers for HIV, HbsAg and blood sugars done too. 9. Do not Google too much of your symptoms out. 10. Do not correlate too many unnecessary things and do not take stress at any cost, sometimes stress can be responsible for non-healing ulcers.  ', 'Patient': 'Hello doctor, I am a 22-year-old female.

I have ulcers, sore throat, occasional oral thrush, difficulty swallowing, lump on the throat (larynx), night sweats, fever, loose teeth, and abnormal discoloration in mouth. I am currently on birth control patch, Dextro-amphetamine and Cymbalta. I have been struggling for months now with quite a few mouth and throat issues. I have constant mouth ulcers that are taking weeks to heal, I get the sensation that I have not swallowed something completely down and that it stuck so I will keep swallowing and swallowing it drives me mad. It is not easy for me to keep doing this because swallowing feels harder than it should be almost like my throat is too swollen. I have a sore throat 80% of the time. I have odd waves of oral thrush and my mouth also has pale and red areas on my soft palate, my hard palate is just very pale. I have a couple of loose teeth but otherwise in very good shape. Frequent random nose bleeds that are usually heavy but can be light at times. Night sweats every night and feeling easily overheated during the days. I have also now become more concerned since my throat developed a hard lump on the top of my larynx. It feels very swollen where it is almost like it is ready to explode. It does not move and it stays firm putting a lot of pressure on my throat. I am assuming this is why it feels hard to swallow. It does not hurt but if I push on it to feel the firmness it causes discomfort to the surroundings mostly underneath the lump.'}, {'id': 1977, 'Description': 'Q. I get back pain at rest with tingling sensation during sleep. Why?', 'Doctor': 'Hi. You are very young to actually have persistent back pains. There are many causes of pain in the lower back region. It can be due to faulty posture, related to weak muscles, issues with intervertebral disc, narrowing of spinal canal, or any bony instability besides many others. So accurate diagnosis is the key to proper management of the condition. You will have to elaborate your problem as to a detailed discussion of your back pain which means the duration of pain and mode of onset. I would also like to ask you if it is associated with any leg pain or any other neurological symptoms like numbness, paraesthesias (electrical shock like abnormal sensations), or any weakness in limbs? Any associated symptoms like fever, weight loss, etc? What medications are you generally taking until now for your existing problem? If you have localized back pain with no other symptoms like radiating leg pain, neurological symptoms like numbness, weakness, paresthesia, etc, then you can start with the following recommendations for an initial period of two to three weeks. 1. Maintain proper posture of your back while working and sleeping. 2. If pain is more then you can take a short course of anti-inflammatory medication like Etoricoxib or Paracetamol or one which suits you. 3. Physical therapy initially under the supervision of a trained physiotherapist and then to continue at home. 4. Adequate calcium and Vitamin D intake, if levels are low in the body. 5. Ice packs can be applied if your pain is acute, then hot fomentation can be done at home. 6. Analgesic spray for local application can be used and is easily available. 7. Avoid lifting heavyweight, acute forward bending in the mornings, etc. We will observe you for the next two to three weeks how you respond to this conservative management protocol. If you are not feeling better, then we will have to get some investigations like, dynamic x-rays of lower back and few blood tests for evaluation.

Will Inderal provoke wheezing and allergic episodes in cardiac patients?', 'Doctor': 'Hello. I have gone through the history you have described for your mother. I really appreciate the way you have presented it with all details. It is very important to know the reason to start tablet Inderal at first point. What kind of arrhythmia it was and all in order to evaluate does she really need to continue any beta blocker. As your Cardiologist year ago after cardiac evaluation did not find any reason to continue the medication as per your history. As we see in a day to day practice patients with palpitations just due to anxiety or stress and without any cardiac issue, non-selective beta blockers would definitely aggravate her symptoms. BP you have mentioned in your description is wrong I guess. As it appears to be 12/20 something, might be a type error but looks normal to me. For time being you can change the beta blocker to a selective beta blocker like Metaprolol (12.5 mg) or Nebivolol (2.5 mg) or Atenelol (25 mg)on a very low dose. Get her evaluated again with her cardiac reports whenever possible and if not required better to slowly taper her beta blocker medication and stop as well. Because though cardioselective beta blockers has some or minimal effect on beta 2 receptors as well. Even I would advise to start meditation and yoga to overcome her anxiety issue, that will help her in controlling palpitations if they are related. Would like to review her all previous and recent cardiac records to further discuss and clarify management strategy.

She had a history of hyper/hypothyroidism about 10 years ago, but the last two years her thyroid has been managed and she stopped taking T4. Her cardiologist told her about 10 years ago to start taking Inderal (Propranolol 20 mg per day divided in a two time dose) because she had palpitations and some arrhythmias. She had an echo/ecg about a year ago and her heart was fine and her cardiologist suggested stopping Inderal. But being a very anxious person and having frequently anxiety tachycardias she did not stop it. Which brings me to the present, having been diagnosed the past six months by her pulmonologist with allergic rhinitis/asthma and having frequent wheezing episodes, even though she takes antihistamines when the episodes occur. Shouldn't she change her beta-blocker to a cardio-selective one? She finds herself not being able to breathe while on Inderal, but the symptoms reappear when she takes it. What would you recommend as a cardioselective beta-blocker? Would it be safe to change from Inderal, to let us say Atenolol? If yes, how would she do it?\"}, {'id': 1987, 'Description': 'Q.

This is usually an isolated incident. It is considered idiopathic, which is just a fancy way of saying we do not know what causes it. If there is a history of this happening before sometimes lab work is ordered to rule out various diseases. Those might include things like Crohn's disease or Sarcoidosis or Spondyloarthritis. For an anterior uveitis there is nothing over the counter (OTC) to treat it. A visit to an eye doctor to confirm this tentative diagnosis is in order. If you are a contact lens wearer this could be a corneal ulcer, those present the same way as an anterior uveitis. Anterior uveitis. Again, there is nothing over the counter for this. If you indeed have an anterior uveitis it would need to be treated with prescription steroid drops. And we need to be careful with steroid drops, if you have an eye infection the steroid will make the eye infection much worse.

For the index finger, I used Onabet cream - twice a day - for three weeks on the nailfold (completed). Also, Loceryl nail lacquer once a week for 6 months.   I cannot take oral antifungal due to previous allergic reaction so my doctor recommended Nadoxin cream twice a day on ring finger nailfold (for 1 week) along with Augmentin 625 mg (for 5 days).

As far as small cysts are concerned they are unmatured eggs which failed to induce menstrual cycle previously, as a result, they got collected in the ovary and they will remain in the ovary. Now, you have got your periods you can start trying for conception. But I advise you to do it under the supervision of a nearby gynecologist because egg size is important while conception and that you can know by ovulation study. Ovulation study is performed under the supervision of a gynecologist. For gall stones, surgical intervention is required generally. Medicine is not of much help.

Then I had checked whether the cysts were dissolved by having an abdomen scan. But still, small multiple follicules have been seen in it with both ovaries enlarged.
